//! LOAD-BEARING canary suite (finding T) — KEEP IN THE SUITE. The decider's hardcoded snapshot offsets
//! MUST equal HEADER_LEN + offset_of!(real percolator struct, field), and its subledger Position offsets
//! MUST equal the subledger's canonical layout. If percolator reorders PortfolioAccountV16Account or the
//! subledger reorders Position, these fail — preventing the GT/HF-class drift where a consumer reads at
//! stale offsets against a rebuilt dependency. A drift that silently shifted the residual reward reads is a
//! free-farm/DoS (e.g. `spent` reading an always-0 field stops penalizing churn; reading a large field nets
//! every trader claim to 0), so this canary is the SOLE structural guard against it — do not delete.
//!
//! (The earlier "[branch-only, DO NOT PUSH]" header was STALE: this file is committed on master, passes, and
//! is actively maintained — the whole workspace already builds from local-path git deps, so it carries no
//! extra portability coupling. It must ship with the suite.)
