# Percolator Meta

A **non-custodial, Sybil-resistant governance bootstrap** for Percolator markets.
Depositors put capital at risk in a Percolator market's insurance to earn time-weighted
voting power over how a **fixed, pre-existing COIN supply** is distributed. The winning
distribution *is* the MetaDAO token; control of the market keys then transfers to it
through a time-locked Squads handover. No program here ever custodies user funds or sits
in the withdrawal path beyond a tightly-constrained, time-locked authority.

> **Status.** Experimental, **educational-use-only**, provided **AS IS** with no warranties
> (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). Participants put real capital **at risk** in a live market and
> can lose it to market losses — the deposit is a Sybil-resistance bond, not an investment.

## Premise

- **Depositing is a Sybil check, not an investment.** There is no yield and no profit share.
  The cost of a vote is the capital-at-risk itself, which is what makes votes expensive to Sybil.
- **COIN is a fixed supply with no mint authority.** Genesis does not mint — it *allocates* a
  pre-existing pool. No inflation, dilution, or mint-to-drain vector exists.
- **The DAO cannot take a user's principal.** User capital lives in Percolator insurance, never
  in a genesis-owned vault. The genesis programs do attribution/accounting only; the one path to
  unconstrained authority is a key rotation that runs through a **1-week Squads timelock**, giving
  every depositor a pre-announced window to exit first.

## Modules

How they fit: a depositor's stake is recorded by **subledger**; **genesis-vote** (or the
alternative **residual-distributor**) reads that stake to decide a winner and seals it into
**distribution**, which pays out the fixed COIN pool; post-mint, **Squads** rotates the market's
insurance authority to **twap-program**, which buys and burns COIN from surplus. The two deciders
are interchangeable behind the same distribution seam.

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `subledger/` | The market's **asset-0 insurance operator** during genesis (a role granted by Squads). Mediates deposits (signs Percolator `TopUpInsurance` as the insurance authority) and owner-authorized exits, tracking per-owner attribution (`owner, principal, start_slot`). Genesis pools are **share-based** (ERC4626-style): exiting redeems shares at the live balance, returning principal **plus any surplus**, pro-rata under loss. Never rotates keys — `accept_operator` only *consents* to receive the role Squads grants. Also provides reusable owner-bound pools for assets 1..N. |
| `genesis-vote/` | The **vote decider**. Runs a log-time quorum vote weighted by each voter's subledger attribution (`floor(log2(hold_time)) × principal`), one voter → one proposal. Seals the winner into `distribution` by CPI. Holds no funds. |
| `residual-distributor/` | The **deterministic decider** — a pluggable alternative to `genesis-vote` behind the same seam. Awards points across 4 cohorts (insurance/backing = subledger share value; LP/trader = Percolator residual counters) via self-service `register → crystallize → freeze → claim`. Requires a **market allow-list** (see below). |
| `distribution/` | Holds the fixed COIN pool in a vault. A proposal is one on-chain account of up to ~10k `(pubkey, amount)` entries; the sealed winner's recipients **claim** permissionlessly, **unclaimed is burned**. Never mints. The `authority` (whichever decider PDA) is bound into the config seed, making it decider-pluggable. |
| `twap-program/` | Deployable BPF for the **authority chain** and the post-mint **uniform-price (Dutch) buy/burn auction**. After the mint, Squads rotates the asset-0 insurance operator to its PDA; it then runs permissionless rounds that pull the burn-share of insurance *surplus*, clear a ranked, uncancellable bid book at one marginal price, and burn (or treasury-send) the bought COIN. Never reaches principal. |
| `twap/` | Reference library for the buy/burn (schedule + bid book); only its overflow-safe rate comparator is reused on-chain. |
| `setup/` | Host-side helper: init the fixed-supply 42M COIN mint and revoke the mint authority. |
| `program/`, `governance/` | The original *custodial* single-program design — superseded by the above, retained and green, removable. |

## Lifecycle

1. **Deposit** through the subledger (the insurance authority) into market-0 insurance; it signs the
   Percolator top-up and records `owner, principal, start_slot` (last-write-time, so topping up resets
   the vote clock). Stake is held as shares.
2. **Vote** — `genesis-vote` reads the attribution. Weight = `floor(log2(hold_time)) × principal`,
   resolved at vote time. Backing a different proposal requires retracting first.
   Quorum = `total_voted_principal × 2 > outstanding`; winner = `support_weight × 2 > total_cast_weight`.
3. **Exit / veto (any time)** — redeem shares through the subledger for principal + surplus (pro-rata
   under loss). A live voter must **retract first**; the vote-lock blocks any withdraw not preceded by
   a retract, so a voter exits via a single atomic `[retract, withdraw]` transaction. Exiting shrinks
   `outstanding`, recomputing quorum against whoever stays — *those who stay decide*. This makes leaving
   the depositor's veto on a capture attempt.
4. **Trigger (permissionless)** — the first proposal to clear quorum + weighted majority is sealed into
   `distribution` by CPI. No mint.
5. **Claim / burn** — winning recipients claim their entry from the fixed COIN vault; unclaimed is burned.
6. **Handoff (post-mint)** — control rotates `DAO → Squads (1-week timelock) → twap-program → Percolator`;
   the insurance authority moves from the principal-safe subledger to the surplus-only twap-program.
7. **Buy/burn (permissionless, repeating)** — each round, anyone `place_bid`s (escrow COIN, offer it for
   USD at a limit rate; a flat anti-spam fee is burned per bid). Bids can't be yanked to spoof a pending
   execute — early they can only be evicted by a strictly-better bid. When the round's slots expire,
   anyone calls `execute`: it pulls the burn-share (DAO-set, default 80%) of the current surplus, ratchets
   the retained share into the protected principal counter (so it compounds in insurance), clears the book
   at one marginal price (every winner pays the same; better bidders give less COIN, surplus refunded),
   and burns the bought COIN (or sends it to a DAO sink). Winners then `claim` their USD.

## Authority chain & the 1-week timelock

`DAO → Squads (1/1, 1-week timelock) → {subledger | twap-program} → Percolator`.

A program-created [Squads v4](https://squads.so) 1/1 multisig holds the market's asset-0 `asset_admin`
and is the **sole key-rotator**. At genesis it grants the insurance operator role to the subledger; post-mint
it rotates it to the twap-program — both via `UpdateAssetAuthority{asset_index:0}`, and Percolator requires the
incoming key to co-sign (the powerless `accept_operator` hooks). Every power-expanding rotation passes through
the one-week timelock, in the clear, with the old constrained authority still live — which is the user-exit
backstop: it bounds the blast radius of *any* bug in genesis-vote/distribution/chain to "users get a one-week,
pre-announced exit window."

## Market allow-list (residual-distributor)

The LP/trader cohorts award points from Percolator portfolio counters that **anyone who controls a market's
oracle can manufacture for free** (stand up an auth-mark market, self-trade delta-neutral, push the mark →
arbitrary `crystallized_loss`/`received` for the price of fees). So a portfolio counts only if its market is
on an orchestrator-vetted allow-list of trusted-Pyth markets (`market_group` + up to 9 extras, bound at `init`).
**Setup:** the creator holds the markets' authority key locally, stands up and vets N Pyth markets, then transfers
that key to the PDA that rotates it to the DAO via the same 1-week Squads timelock — so listed markets can never
be repointed at an attacker oracle once points accrue. The allow-list bounds *who can mint points at all*, not
wash-farming among already-trusted markets; see `residual-distributor/DESIGN.md` and `sim/` for that analysis.

Tests load the **real** binaries (Percolator at `../percolator-prog/target/deploy/percolator_prog.so`,
real Squads v4 at `program/tests/fixtures/squads_v4.so`, plus the locally-built crates) — CPIs run against
the actual programs, not mocks. The e2e needs those `.so` files prebuilt and `../percolator-prog` built.
