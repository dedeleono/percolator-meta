//! Market-0 TWAP buy/burn program — the percolator-facing link of the genesis

//!
//!   DAO (metadao_futarchy)  →  Squads multisig (1-week timelock)  →  THIS program
//!       →  percolator market-0 insurance
//!
//! After the genesis mint, the percolator market-0 insurance authority/operator is
//! rotated from the subledger to this program's `twap_authority` PDA. From then on
//! the TWAP is what touches insurance: it pulls the configured surplus share and
//! (in later slices) buys + burns COIN with it. The TWAP itself is *configured* only
//! by its `squads` controller — a Squads multisig whose `config_authority` is the
//! DAO — so the DAO controls percolator insurance only through the timelocked Squads
//! path. The pull crank is permissionless (anyone may turn it) but bounded by the
//! Squads-set parameters.
//!
//! This slice wires the on-chain keystone: the config that pins the whole chain, and
//! the `twap_authority` PDA signing the percolator insurance CPI. The Squads
//! vault-execute reconfigure path and the COIN buy/burn settlement build on top.
