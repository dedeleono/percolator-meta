# Security analysis log (adversarial LOF/DOS sweep)

Running note so the 5-min loop doesn't repeat vectors. Format: vector → verdict.

## Analyzed

### [FIXED] A. Stale quorum denominator → minority capture (genesis-vote trigger)
`trigger` checked quorum against `config.outstanding_principal`, a CACHE synced
only on `vote`. Attack: vote early when the subledger pool is tiny (cache=6), let
honest deposits grow the pool to 1006 without a re-vote, then trigger: 6*2 > 6
(stale cache) "passes" → a 6-principal minority captures the whole COIN
distribution. FIX: trigger now takes the subledger pool account and re-reads the
LIVE `outstanding_principal` for the quorum check. Regression:
`genesis-vote/tests/seal.rs::trigger_uses_live_pool_outstanding_not_stale_cache`.

### [FIXED] B. Vote outlives capital (genesis-vote support tallies are snapshots)
FIXED via a cross-program vote-lock (a boolean, simpler than the candidate
`locked_principal` since one position = one whole vote). The subledger Position
gained a `vote_locked` flag and the Pool a `vote_authority` (= the genesis-vote
config PDA); a new `IX_SET_VOTE_LOCK` (tag 6) lets ONLY that authority toggle it,
and `process_insurance_withdraw` refuses while set. genesis-vote `vote` now CPIs
SetVoteLock(1) on back / SetVoteLock(0) on retract (config PDA signs). A live
ballot pins its principal in the subledger; capital can leave only after the vote
is retracted — which the owner always controls, so no permanent-freeze risk. This
restores the "voters must retract before exit" invariant the single-program
genesis had. Regression (KEPT, real-percolator e2e):
insurance_percolator.rs::vote_locked_principal_cannot_exit_until_retracted
(vote → withdraw refused → retract → withdraw succeeds). Original analysis:

genesis-vote records `voted_principal`/`support_*` as a snapshot at vote time, but
the capital lives in the SUBLEDGER and the subledger `insurance_withdraw` does NOT
require the genesis-vote ballot to be retracted first. So a voter can vote
(support += P), then withdraw P from the subledger (capital returned), and the
ballot still counts toward quorum/majority with ZERO capital at risk — a free /
Sybil vote. WORSE after fix A: the live-outstanding denominator shrinks on exit
while the snapshot numerator stays, inflating quorum. The old single-program
genesis enforced retract-before-exit; the cross-program split broke it.
Candidate fix: genesis-vote vote/retract CPIs the subledger to set a
`locked_principal` on the position; subledger `insurance_withdraw` cannot reduce
principal below `locked_principal`. (Subledger exposes the lock to a registered
vote-authority only.) NEXT ITERATION.

### [FIXED] B2. Vote-lock freeze-after-finalize (regression from B's fix)
Adversarial self-review of B's fix: genesis-vote `vote` rejected ALL actions once
a proposal was sealed (`pv.executed`), so a WINNING voter could never retract to
clear the subledger vote-lock → principal frozen forever. FIX: post-seal forbid
only NEW backing (VOTE_BACK); always allow VOTE_RETRACT (clears the lock; seal is
immutable; post-seal tally writes are unread). Regression:
insurance_percolator.rs::winning_voter_can_retract_and_exit_after_finalize
(drives the real trigger to seal, then proves retract+exit works post-finalize).

### [FIXED] E. Distribution vault solvency not enforced at init (claim-race LOF)
`init_config` recorded `total_supply` from instruction data and validated the
vault's mint/owner, but never checked the vault was FUNDED to total_supply. The
seal only enforces `total_amount <= total_supply` (the claimed number), so a config
whose vault held less than promised would let early claimants drain it and STRAND
honest late claimants (first-come claim race). FIX: init now requires
`vault.amount >= total_supply` (InsufficientFunds otherwise), tying the promised
supply to real tokens — a config can never promise more than the vault holds, and
since seal caps total_amount at total_supply, every sealed proposal is fully
claimable. Test (KEPT): distribution.rs::init_config_rejects_an_underfunded_vault.

### [BLOCKED] Distribution claim/seal/append/burn — full adversarial read (tick 5)
Probed the entire distribution fund-exit surface; all well-defended:
- claim: pull model (`pk == recipient.key`), sealed-proposal pin, vault pin, window
  bound, index bound, double-claim zeroing (amount==0 reject). recipient_ata is
  unchecked but that is the recipient directing their OWN allocation — not theft.
- append_entries: rejected once `header.sealed || config.is_sealed()` (no post-seal
  drain), running `total_amount <= total_supply`, checked_add, capacity bound.
- seal_winner: authority==config.authority, not-already-sealed, `header.config ==
  config` (no foreign-proposal seal), `entry_count > 0`, total_amount <= supply.
- burn_unclaimed: sealed-only, vault+mint pinned, `clock.slot < window_end` blocks
  premature burns. No tests added (would only re-assert existing checks).

### [FIXED] F. Foreign distribution proposal → unsealable winner (finalize DOS)
genesis-vote `register_proposal` checked `distribution_proposal.owner ==
config.distribution_program` but NOT that the proposal belonged to
`config.distribution_config`. A proposal owned by the distribution program but
under a DIFFERENT config could be registered and voted on; `trigger` pins the
distribution_config to `config.distribution_config` and CPIs SealWinner against it,
which the distribution rejects on `header.config` mismatch. So a foreign-linked
proposal that WON could never be sealed → the genesis could never finalize (the
whole bootstrap bricks; the COIN/MetaDAO never forms). Voters can still retract+exit
(no fund freeze) but the protocol is dead. FIX: register_proposal now reads the
distribution proposal header (disc `DISTPRP1`, config at [8..40]) and requires it to
equal `config.distribution_config` — every votable proposal is guaranteed sealable.
Test (KEPT, real cross-program e2e with a second distribution config):
insurance_percolator.rs::register_rejects_foreign_distribution_proposal.
NOTE (low-risk, NOT fixed): a proposal under the correct config but with
entry_count==0 would also fail seal (seal requires entry_count>0); but entries can
be appended any time pre-seal and no rational voter backs an empty (zero-allocation)
proposal, so it is self-correcting, not a forced DOS.

### [FIXED] G. Hostile vote_authority → griefing freeze of depositors (LOF)
`init_insurance_pool` is permissionless and records `vote_authority` as-is (no
validation). An attacker could front-run creation of the genesis's (COIN, asset-0)
insurance pool with `vote_authority = attacker`. `set_vote_lock` required ONLY the
vote_authority to sign — so the attacker could then lock ANY depositor's position
(`set_vote_lock(victim, 1)`), and `insurance_withdraw` refuses while locked. The
real genesis-vote config PDA is NOT the authority, so it cannot unlock → victims'
principal FROZEN forever (griefing LOF). FIX: `set_vote_lock` now also requires the
position OWNER to sign (and `position.owner == owner`). A position can therefore
only be (un)locked in the context of its owner acting on their own vote — the only
legitimate case. The vote_authority gate stays so the owner cannot self-unlock and
bypass retract (which would re-open finding B). genesis-vote `vote` propagates the
voter's signature into the SetVoteLock CPI. Test (KEPT, real-percolator e2e):
insurance_percolator.rs::hostile_vote_authority_cannot_freeze_a_depositor.

### [FIXED] H. genesis-vote init_config didn't bind its wired dependencies
`init_config` stored `distribution_config` and `subledger_pool` as-is, with NO
check that they bind back to the config being created. An honest orchestrator could
thus wire the genesis to a poisoned/foreign pool or distribution config (e.g. the
front-run pool of finding G), silently bricking it: a subledger pool whose
vote_authority != this config PDA makes every vote's SetVoteLock CPI fail (no one
can vote), and a distribution config whose seal authority != this config PDA (or
for another mint) makes trigger's SealWinner always fail (finalize DOS). FIX: init
now requires, for this coin_mint, that (a) distribution_config is a real DISTCFG1
owned by distribution_program with coin_mint match and authority == config PDA, and
(b) subledger_pool is a real SUBPOOL1 owned by subledger_program with mint match and
vote_authority == config PDA. The config can only be created against dependencies
that recognize it — fail-fast at init instead of a mysterious brick at vote/trigger.
Complements finding G (G stops the freeze; H stops building on a poisoned pool).
Test (KEPT): seal.rs::init_config_rejects_pool_not_bound_to_this_config.

### [BLOCKED] Own-vault init_pool vault-substitution theft (now pinned by a test)
Probed: own-vault `deposit` (tag 1) transfers owner -> pool.vault and `withdraw`
(tag 2) pays from pool.vault signed by the pool PDA. If `init_pool` accepted a vault
owned by the attacker, they could stand up a pool, lure a deposit into their own
token account, and drain it directly via SPL (program withdraw would fail). Already
blocked: init_pool pins `vault_state.owner == pool PDA` (src line ~350). Added a
regression to lock this anti-theft invariant (it was previously untested):
subledger.rs::init_pool_rejects_a_vault_not_owned_by_the_pool.

### [BLOCKED] vote_weight arithmetic overflow (genesis-vote)
`vote_weight = floor(log2(age)) * principal` uses `saturating_mul` (no wrap/panic)
and accumulation uses `checked_add` (graceful error). Saturating to u64::MAX needs
~2^58 real deposited tokens — self-bounded by capital, not attacker-reachable. No
fix/test needed.

### [BLOCKED] Subledger insurance_deposit holding-account substitution
`process_insurance_deposit` does not validate the `holding` account, but the
TopUpInsurance CPI's internal SPL transfer is authorized by the pool PDA, so
percolator requires `holding` to be pool-PDA-owned; a hostile holding makes the CPI
revert (whole tx reverts, user's step-1 transfer with it). The user pre-funds
`holding` with exactly `amount` and is credited `amount` — no path credits more
than entered or touches another user. Well defended; no test added.

### [BLOCKED] Subledger pool/position substitution in genesis-vote `vote`
`vote` pins `sub_pool == config.subledger_pool`, derives the position PDA from
that pool + voter, re-checks the stored pool/owner, and requires subledger-program
ownership. A foreign high-principal position cannot be substituted. Well defended;
no test added (would only re-assert existing checks).

### [FIXED] C. Pool type-confusion: own-vault path accepted an insurance pool
The subledger serves both own-vault pools (tags 1/2, funds in a pool-PDA-owned
vault) and percolator-insurance pools (tags 4/5, funds in the percolator
insurance vault). The insurance handlers already gated on `!pool.is_insurance()`,
but the own-vault `deposit`/`withdraw` had NO matching guard. Attack/footgun:
call own-vault deposit (tag 1) on an insurance pool — the SPL transfer pushes the
user's funds straight into the percolator insurance vault with NO TopUpInsurance
CPI (percolator never counts them) and records an own-vault position; the own-vault
withdraw can never sign those funds back out (the pool PDA is not the insurance
vault's token authority) → principal STRANDED (user LOF). FIX: added the symmetric
`if pool.is_insurance() { return Err }` guard to own-vault deposit AND withdraw.
Test (KEPT — pins a real stranded-funds boundary against the real percolator
binary): subledger/tests/insurance_percolator.rs::
own_vault_deposit_is_rejected_on_an_insurance_pool.

### [FIXED] D. Active-path canonical-vault pin (GH issue #24 / PR #25)
GH issue #24 + PR #25 (@SrMessiSOL) report that percolator-meta accepts a
non-canonical Percolator vault. ADVERSARIAL REVIEW of PR #25: the diff derives
the canonical ATA `[vault_authority, spl_token::ID, mint]` under the REAL ATA
program id and equality-checks it — byte-for-byte identical to percolator's own
`canonical_vault_address` (F-VAULT-FRAG). It is ADDITIVE (keeps the existing
mint/owner check) and can never reject a vault percolator would accept (percolator
enforces the same pin), so NO DOS and NOT a backdoor. The PR is legitimate but
targets the DEPRECATED custodial program/, whose integration suite no longer
compiles on master OR the PR branch due to percolator interface drift
(WrapperConfigV16 authority fields renamed) — unrelated to the PR.
The same gap existed on the ACTIVE path: subledger init_insurance_pool checked
`owner == vault_authority` + mint but did NOT pin the canonical ATA address. Not
exploitable (a non-canonical pool is simply inert — every deposit/withdraw CPI
reverts with InvalidVaultAccount), but a fail-fast pin is correct. FIX: added
`canonical_vault_address` to subledger and pinned it in init_insurance_pool.
Test (KEPT): insurance_percolator.rs::init_insurance_pool_rejects_non_canonical_vault.
