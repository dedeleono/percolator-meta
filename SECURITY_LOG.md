# Security analysis log (adversarial LOF/DOS sweep)

Running note so the 5-min loop doesn't repeat vectors. Format: vector → verdict.

## Checkpoint (latest)
Reachable six-binary surface is exhausted: 53 vectors recorded (A–AX), of which 3 were real CRITICAL
bugs found + fixed by this loop (AD signer-seed-binding, AI lamport-prefund init-DOS, AQ parasite-config
insurance drain) plus 1 real correctness fix (AS self-loop buyback sink). Full regression GREEN at this
checkpoint: 136 tests across every harness (subledger insurance 27 + own-vault 5 + lib 6 = 38; genesis-vote
seal 9 + lib 3 = 12; distribution 13 + lib 4 = 17; twap chain 65 + lib 4 = 69; 38+12+17+69 = 136), full
suite green, and all four programs build-sbf clean.
On-chain FIXES this run: twap init_config enforces the bound Squads multisig time_lock >= 1 week; twap
cancel_bid no longer lets a no-op roll unlock the anti-spoof cooldown early (external issue #28).
Missing-signer guards pinned across the stack: twap reconfigure, subledger set_vote_lock, distribution
seal_winner (each verified that a privileged KEY match without a SIGNATURE is rejected).
Config-mutator auth fully covered: set_reserved_floor / set_reserve / set_coin_sink / shutdown / reconfigure
all have a direct non-Squads (or non-signing) rejection test.
All four permissionless-init PDAs (subledger pool, twap book, gv config, distribution config) now have a
finding-AI lamport-prefund-DOS regression test. The eviction refund-redirect guard is pinned inside
`e2e_full_book_evicts_only_for_a_strictly_better_bid` (extended, mutation-verified).
The percolator dep is pinned to committed revs (percolator-prog c050578, percolator 76d0e75), so a
sibling mid-edit no longer breaks the build. Recent ticks are confirmations, not new findings; the
remaining surface is runtime-guaranteed (e.g. AU SPL-authority), DAO-footgun hardening, or OFF this
harness (the `rewards-program` monolith with its own suite; the unbuilt local proposal-generation tool,
whose bugs are the realistic trigger for program-level footguns like AS). Recommend redirecting the loop
to one of those, or pausing it.

## Analyzed

### [ATTESTATION] Coverage map — Copenhagen classes x repo boundaries (136 tests, build-sbf clean)
Consolidated reference after the multi-tick sweep. Every Copenhagen class and repo-specific boundary maps to
an enforcing test/finding (LOF/DOS verdict in parens):
COPENHAGEN CLASSES:
- account confusion / substitution: parasite-config drain (AQ), foreign market_slab/vault/vault_authority at
  execute + withdraw (AF, e2e_execute_rejects_*), canonical-vault F-VAULT (init_..._rejects_non_canonical),
  eviction-refund redirect, claim usd_dest/coin_ata pins (AW), deposit holding (HARDENING).
- missing owner/signer: reconfigure/set_vote_lock/seal_winner is_signer pins (mutation-verified), withdraw
  owner-binding (non_owner_cannot_withdraw), accept_operator bypass (e2e_attacker_cannot_grant_operator_*).
- PDA/seed collisions: config bindings P/Q/R/AA/AQ (gv config, dist config, twap config, subledger pool).
- type cosplay: owner+disc+offset checks; ALL four cross-program discs verified equal + offsets match (gv->
  subledger/distribution); two percolator readers offset_of!-canaried.
- arbitrary CPI: percolator_program/subledger_program/distribution_program pinned to config before every CPI.
- reinit: data_len gate + robust create, tested (insurance_pool / gv_config reinit, finding AJ).
- rounding: pro-rata haircut floor (finding L, order-independent), uniform-price floor + coin_i==0 unfilled
  (AE roll restore), ratchet burnable+retained==surplus (no residual). All conservative/bounded.
- missing rent/exempt (prefund DOS): robust create for ALL 4 init PDAs (subledger pool, twap book, gv config,
  distribution config) — finding AI, mutation-verified.
- sysvar spoofing: N/A — programs use Clock::get() syscall, never a passed sysvar account.
- duplicate accounts: pinned + mint-typed accounts cannot alias harmfully (different mints/owners/pinned keys).
- remaining-account smuggling: SEND coin_sink read only in SEND mode + pinned; BURN/claim/trigger fixed lists.
REPO BOUNDARIES: subledger insurance-authority-vs-operator (accept_operator hardcoded-to-pool + Squads), gv
weight/quorum (weight-0 flash-deposit, vote-lock self-unlock, live-outstanding by design), distribution
claim/seal (cross-proposal isolation, missing-signer seal, freeze/mint/supply, bait-and-switch snapshot), twap
auction (anti-spoof cancel #28 FIXED, roll restore, double-claim, book-squat init_book, reserve/sink/floor
Squads-gated), Squads 1-week timelock (enforced on-chain at init FIXED + before-expiry tests), finding-O floor
(execute pulls only surplus), finding-T offset (canaried both readers).
OFF-HARNESS (task #6 orchestration, on-chain-uncloseable): deposit-deadline/kickstart (bounds the exit-capture
#20-1 + the deposit-inflate-quorum griefing), durable timelock, handover-bound-to-vote-winner (#20-2).
Verdict: on-chain surface comprehensively covered; 2 real fixes (timelock-min, #28), 1 hardening (deposit
holding) this run; residual risk consolidated in the 3 off-harness orchestration requirements.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] gv->distribution offsets verified — completes the finding-T-family cross-program audit
Closed the last raw-byte-offset cross-program read I had not explicitly checked: genesis-vote reads the
distribution proposal by hardcoded offsets in register_proposal (creator-binding + snapshot) and trigger
(bait-and-switch snapshot). Cross-checked ALL of them against the REAL distribution ProposalHeader
(distribution/src/lib.rs): disc `DISTPRP1` @ [0..8], config [8..40], creator [48..80], entry_count [84..88],
total_amount [88..96] — gv reads (lib.rs:456/459/470/474-475/727-728) MATCH exactly. e2e-validated: the
full-genesis chain/subledger tests create REAL distribution proposals via the real distribution program, so a
distribution layout drift would make register/trigger mis-read and fail (drift-catching — unlike the
hand-edited percolator slab, no separate canary is required).
This completes the finding-T-family audit of every cross-program raw-offset read:
  twap->percolator insurance@749     — own offset_of! canary (e2e hand-edits, canary required)
  subledger->percolator insurance@749 — own offset_of! canary (e2e hand-edits, canary required)
  gv->subledger Position/Pool         — e2e-validated with real positions (drift-catching)
  gv->distribution ProposalHeader     — e2e-validated with real proposals (drift-catching)
DISC VALUES also verified directly (not just inferred from the e2e): the four discriminators gv hardcodes
match the real source constants EXACTLY — gv SUB_POSITION_DISC `SUBPOS01` == subledger POSITION_DISC; gv
SUB_POOL_DISC `SUBPOOL1` == subledger POOL_DISC; gv DIST_PROPOSAL_DISC `DISTPRP1` == distribution PROPOSAL_DISC;
gv DIST_CONFIG_DISC `DISTCFG1` == distribution CONFIG_DISC. So the gv's type-cosplay defenses (owner + disc +
offset) are sound: a substituted account of the wrong type is rejected on the disc, and a real account is read
at the correct fields. No unit canary is added for the intra-repo couplings (gv->subledger, gv->distribution)
because the full-genesis e2e exercises them with REAL accounts and so catches any drift; the cross-repo
percolator reads keep their offset_of! canaries (the e2e there hand-edits and cannot).
Verdict: every foreign-struct raw-offset read is either canaried against the real struct or e2e-validated
with real data, and every cross-program discriminator matches; no silent-drift or type-cosplay gap. No code
change, no new test.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] Deposit/withdraw validation-parity sweep complete — holding was the only asymmetry
Swept the paired subledger operations for validation asymmetries (the class that surfaced the deposit-holding
hardening below — the kind the external auditor flags):
- holding: was the one genuine gap (withdraw validated it, deposit didn't) — now symmetric (HARDENING entry
  below; doubly-defended either way).
- vault_authority: BOTH the withdraw and the twap execute pin `vault_authority == perc_vault_authority(slab,
  perc)` explicitly (subledger lib.rs:1019). The market-binding is covered by `foreign_market_slab_cannot_
  inflate_the_haircut` (AF) — it rejects a substituted slab at the EARLIER `market_slab != pool.market_slab`
  pin (lib.rs:851); the direct foreign-vault_authority-with-real-slab case is the same market-binding class,
  rejected at :1019 and doubly-defended by the percolator CPI (the vault is pinned == pool.vault and the
  pool, not vault_authority, signs). The deposit needs no vault_authority at all (TopUp is pool-signed).
- position: deposit re-derives the canonical PDA; withdraw + set_vote_lock use stored-field binding
  (position.owner==owner && position.pool==pool) — sufficient because positions only ever exist at the
  canonical PDA (one per owner per pool), so the stored fields uniquely identify it.
- owner_ata / usd_dest: not validated for ownership by design — the OWNER signs and directs their OWN funds
  (a wrong destination is self-inflicted, never cross-user theft, since a non-owner can't initiate).
Verdict: validation parity is consistent; the holding was the only real asymmetry and is closed. No code
change, no new test (the remaining differences are justified or covered).

### [HARDENING] subledger insurance_deposit — fail-fast holding validation (consistency with withdraw)
Vector probed: insurance_deposit routes funds user -> holding -> percolator insurance vault (TopUpInsurance,
pool-signed). The WITHDRAW validates `holding.owner == pool && holding.mint == pool.mint` up front
(lib.rs:1024), but the DEPOSIT did not — it relied on the pool-signed TopUp CPI to revert on a non-pool/
wrong-mint holding. Asymmetry of exactly the kind the external auditor flags.
Analysis + MUTATION result: NOT a security gap — the deposit was already safe. Mutation-verified: with the
new check REMOVED, `insurance_deposit_rejects_a_non_pool_holding` STILL passes, i.e. the TopUp CPI backstops a
non-pool holding (the pool cannot authorize a transfer from an account it does not own). So a wrong holding
was always rejected and the whole tx reverts (the user->holding leg is rolled back; no LOF). Added the
explicit up-front check anyway as DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH + consistency (a clear fail-fast InvalidAccountData instead
of a downstream CPI revert, and so a wrong holding can never even reach the user->holding transfer).
Added `insurance_deposit_rejects_a_non_pool_holding` pinning the boundary (attacker-owned holding -> rejected,
no credit, capital untouched). KEPT — it is the first test of the deposit-holding boundary (doubly-defended,
documented as such). No LOF was present; this is hardening, not a bug fix.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] Auction state-machine sweep complete — cancel/execute/claim transitions all correctly guarded
Closing the auction state-machine class the external auditor mines (#28 was a cancel-transition bug). Verified
every OPEN<->SETTLED transition is correctly guarded:
- claim -> reopen: claim zeroes the ENTIRE slot (all SLOT_SIZE bytes, clearing OCCUPIED/SETTLED/amounts/place
  marks) then reopens (BK_STATE = OPEN) ONLY if a full scan finds NO occupied slot (`!any`). So the book stays
  SETTLED through partial claims; a new bid can never mix with settled-but-unclaimed state, and a re-bid into
  a freed slot starts byte-clean. (lib.rs process_claim tail.)
- execute: gated on state==OPEN + clock>=round_end; advances round_end once per round; settle marks all
  occupied slots SETTLED (claim-only), roll restores them unsettled byte-identical (finding AE). round_end
  advances ONLY here.
- cancel: gates on `aged` alone now (issue #28 fixed); early exits = settle->claim, strictly-better eviction,
  2*round_length aging. No round_end-delta shortcut remains.
- place_bid: rejected unless state==OPEN, so no bid enters a settling/claiming book.
Verdict: the full auction lifecycle (place -> execute(settle|roll) -> claim -> reopen) has no premature
transition or stale-state-mixing edge; the #28-class is closed. No new test (each transition is already pinned
by the buy-burn/roll/claim/cancel tests), no code change.

### [ORCHESTRATION] Handover not bound on-chain to the vote winner (#20 finding 2) — off-harness requirement
The #20 report's second finding (Low): `handover_genesis_squads` (DEPRECATED monolith program/src/lib.rs)
rotated the Squads config_authority to a caller-supplied key with no check it matches the vote winner. That
exact code is gone, but the concept maps to the current design: the twap config STORES `metadao_futarchy`
and verifies `config_authority(squads_multisig) == metadao_futarchy` (init_config), but has NO on-chain link
binding `metadao_futarchy` to the genesis-vote WINNER — confirmed: twap-program/src/lib.rs references neither
the genesis-vote config, the distribution, nor the sealed winning proposal. So the on-chain check guarantees
internal consistency (the named DAO really controls the multisig), but the orchestration is trusted to set
`metadao_futarchy` (and rotate the config_authority) to the COIN/futarchy the vote actually sealed.
Severity: defence-in-depth (no depositor principal at risk; the COIN supply is provably the genesis COIN via
the distribution invariants + the place_bid coin pin). Not closeable cleanly on-chain: the twap is a separate
program from genesis-vote/distribution and the "winner" is a COIN distribution to many recipients, not a
single key the twap can compare to.
NARROWING (the residual gap is small): the twap's MULTISIG identity is already on-chain-bound — the config
PDA seed folds in `squads_multisig` (finding AQ, lib.rs:416), and accept_operator only completes the operator
grant when `squads_default_vault(config.squads_multisig)` SIGNS (lib.rs accept_operator), so the bound multisig
MUST be the genesis multisig that performed the handoff. And init_config pins `config_authority(multisig) ==
metadao_futarchy`. So the ONLY orchestration-trusted step is rotating THAT genesis multisig's config_authority
to the winning DAO before/at the twap binding — the multisig identity and the authority==DAO consistency are
enforced on-chain. This is the THIRD OFF-HARNESS ORCHESTRATION REQUIREMENT for the unbuilt tool (task #6),
alongside the deposit-deadline/kickstart and the durable 1-week timelock: the orchestration MUST rotate the
genesis Squads config_authority to the futarchy of the COIN the genesis vote sealed.
Verdict: not a current-design on-chain bug (the deprecated handover code is gone; the on-chain consistency
check holds); recorded as an orchestration-tool requirement. No code change.

### [SCOPE] Deprecated workspace members are out of the six-binary probe scope; current handover is covered
Confirmed the probe scope. The workspace (Cargo.toml members) still contains the OLD monolith:
`program/` (genesis monolith + squads_handover.rs), `governance/` (governance adapter), `twap/` (the old
pay-as-bid library with the withdraw_bid spoof hole), `setup/`. These are SUPERSEDED — the live design is the
six binaries the loop targets: subledger, genesis-vote, distribution, twap-program (this repo) + percolator +
Squads v4 (siblings). Issues #1–#25 / PRs #6–#27 mostly audited the deprecated monolith; they do not apply to
the current programs. The deprecated members are NOT probed (not deployed in the current design).
The CURRENT Squads handover (DAO -> Squads multisig (1-week timelock) -> twap_authority operator ->
percolator insurance) is fully covered in the live suite: `handoff_rotates_operator_to_twap_only_after_
timelock`, `handoff_rotates_insurance_policy_only_after_timelock`, `e2e_attacker_cannot_grant_operator_
bypassing_squads`, `e2e_post_handoff_deposit_blocked_by_authority_revoke`, `e2e_subledger_exit_blocked_after_
operator_handoff`, and `twap_config_binds_only_to_a_real_squads_multisig_controlled_by_the_dao` (config_
authority == the DAO). The genesis->DAO config_authority rotation itself is an off-chain orchestration step;
the twap VERIFIES its result on-chain (config_authority == metadao_futarchy) at init_config.
Verdict: full current four-program suite green at 135; the deprecated monolith (program/governance/twap/setup)
is out of scope; the current handover chain is covered. No code change.

### [REVIEW] Full GitHub issue/PR audit (DPRK lens) — #20 verified real but ACCEPTED by design (voluntary exit)
Reviewed ALL issues + PRs (open + closed) adversarially. State: nothing open. Triage:
- #1–#19, #22–#25 + PRs #6–#18, #21–#27: audited the DEPRECATED `percolator-genesis` MONOLITH (mint_reward/
  reward_supply, percolator_admin/RESOLVE_MARKET, activate_live, handover_genesis_squads, transfer_mint_
  authority, init_market_rewards, pull_insurance, governance adapter) — that subsystem was DELETED; obsolete
  in the current four-program design. PR #27 was a regression trap (caught + closed). #26 (one TWAP signer
  across configs) superseded by the AQ config-binding; #24 (non-canonical vault) closed by F-VAULT pins.
- #28 (cancel-cooldown bypass): a real current-design bug — FIXED this run (see FIXED entry).
- #20 (minority captures when committed depositors exit during voting): VERIFIED still real in the CURRENT
  genesis-vote via TDD (`those_who_stay_decide_after_a_nonvoting_majority_forfeits_by_exiting`, subledger
  tests): the trigger reads LIVE pool outstanding, so when a non-voting majority exits, a 2% voter becomes the
  majority of the remainder and seals the whole distribution. BUT this is the INTENDED "those who stay decide"
  design and is ACCEPTED (owner decision, kept): the exit is OWNER-SIGNED (insurance_withdraw requires
  owner.is_signer + position.owner==owner; `principal_only_owner_exit_returns_funds_and_guards` pins that a
  non-owner cannot withdraw), so NO ONE can force the majority out — they leave VOLUNTARILY and with their
  FULL principal (no theft; only COIN governance follows participation). #20's proposed fix (anchor quorum to
  the committed pool) was declined: it trades this capture-resistance for low-turnout STALLS (a passive
  majority could freeze the genesis forever). The complementary deposit-DURING-voting griefing (inflate
  quorum to DOS the trigger) and the deposit-deadline/kickstart that would bound BOTH directions remain the
  documented OFF-HARNESS orchestration requirement (DESIGN-DOS entry below).
Verdict: no open issue is an unaddressed real bug. #28 fixed; #20 accepted-by-design (voluntary exit, no
theft) with a test documenting the intended behavior; the rest are deprecated-monolith or already covered.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] #28-class sweep across state machines — no stale-cache read, no permissionless-advance bug
Generalized the #28 pattern ("a permissionless action advances some state, changing a TIME/STATE guard's
behavior") and swept every state machine + cached value for the same shape:
- genesis-vote quorum cache: `vote` writes `config.outstanding_principal` on every vote, but NO guard reads
  it — `trigger` deliberately RE-READS the live pool outstanding at seal time (lib.rs:737), never the stored
  field. So the cache is vestigial (off-chain visibility only); there is no stale-cache read bug. Using it
  WOULD reopen the stale-low minority-capture hole that `trigger_uses_live_pool_outstanding_not_stale_cache`
  exists to prevent. Clarified the misleading "Sync the quorum denominator" comment so an auditor/the active
  external filer does not mistake it for a stale read.
- twap reserved_floor / round_end / book.state, distribution sealed_proposal / seal_slot+claim_window,
  subledger pool.outstanding: every guard reads the CURRENT value at decision time (no cached snapshot drives
  a decision). round_end advances only via execute (already fixed for cancel, #28). seal_slot is set once by
  the trigger and the window is immutable; a cranker can only DELAY the seal (not shorten the claim window),
  and the trigger rejects until quorum holds.
- Other permissionless cranks (claim->reopen, burn_unclaimed, trigger->executed) advance state but no other
  guard keys off a delta exploitably (claim reopens only when fully drained; burn is terminal; trigger is
  one-shot).
Verdict: #28 was the only instance of the pattern; it is fixed, and no sibling exists in the other state
machines (all guards read live, no cache drives a decision). Comment-only change; suites green at 134.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] Auction anti-spoof — proactive #28-sibling sweep (no other cooldown bypass)
After fixing #28 (no-op roll unlocking cancel), swept the auction state machine for SIBLING bypasses of the
"committed until settled/aged/evicted" anti-spoof — the class the external filer is mining:
- round_end advances ONLY via execute: the sole writes to BK_ROUND_END are init_book (initial) and the
  next-round advance in execute (lib.rs:1533). No instruction moves it otherwise — so post-fix nothing reads
  a round_end delta and nothing but the aging window opens cancel.
- execute is one-per-round + state-gated: requires `state == OPEN` (lib.rs:33) AND `clock_slot >= round_end`
  (:85); after it advances round_end, a second execute in the same slot fails the timing check, and once it
  marks SETTLED a re-execute fails the state check. So a cranker cannot spin executes to age out a bid.
- No eviction-based exit: a committed bid can only leave early by being evicted by a STRICTLY-better bid, and
  one-bid-per-bidder (lib.rs:1164) blocks an attacker from placing a second bid to self-evict their first —
  pinned by chain.rs:3159 ("a bidder cannot stack a second bid"). Cross-account self-eviction just commits an
  even-better bid (net commitment unchanged), so it is not a clean yank either.
Verdict: the only early exits remain settle->claim, eviction by a strictly-better bid, and 2*round_length
aging; no sibling to #28. No new test (the self-eviction block is already pinned), no code change.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] issue-#28 fix completeness — no retroactive aging shrink, no sibling, shutdown-safe
Follow-up verification that the cancel-cooldown fix (FIXED entry below) is complete and side-effect-free:
- `round_length` is IMMUTABLE: written only by init_book (lib.rs:968), no set_round_length instruction, and
  init_book is reinit-guarded. So `aged = place_slot + 2*round_length` cannot be retroactively shrunk to
  re-open an early cancel (a DAO can't lower round_length to age out committed bids faster).
- No sibling round_end-delta vector: SL_PLACE_ROUND_END now has NO functional reader (the removed cancel use
  was the only one); it is written at place_bid + checked by the layout test only. Updated its stale comment.
  Nothing else in the program gates on a `round_end != place_round_end` style delta.
- Shutdown does not strand committed bids: process_shutdown only moves holding->dest; it never touches
  coin_escrow or BK_STATE, so a shutdown leaves committed bids reclaimable via the aged cancel (or eviction).
  `e2e_shutdown_cannot_drain_escrow_or_settlement` already pins that shutdown can't reach the escrow.
Verdict: fix is complete; the only early exits for a committed bid are now SETTLE (->claim), EVICTION by a
strictly-better bid, and the 2*round_length aging window. No code change beyond the stale-comment fix.

### [FIXED] twap cancel_bid — no-op roll unlocked the anti-spoof cooldown early (external issue #28)
Vector (external report, issue #28 by SrMessiSOL — same filer as the PR #27 regression trap, so reviewed
adversarially): process_cancel_bid gated cancel on `cleared || aged`, where `cleared = book.round_end !=
place_round_end` and `aged = now >= place_slot + 2*round_length`. The intent of `cleared` was "a settlement
cleared the book," but process_execute advances round_end on EVERY run — including a no-op ROLL (total_coin
== 0, routine at surplus 0) that leaves the bid OCCUPIED + unsettled. So a bidder could post a bid to shape
the book, crank a permissionless no-op roll (advancing round_end), and yank the bid well INSIDE the intended
2*round_length window — re-opening the last-second-cancel manipulation the cooldown was built (vs the old
library's withdraw_bid) to prevent. Net: a shape-the-book-then-yank seller-griefing (other sellers, reacting
to the fake supply, bid aggressively and clear at a worse price next round); the report confirms NO
third-party theft (only the attacker's own escrow moves), so it is a low-severity anti-spoof weakening, not
a LOF — but it is a genuine deviation from the design's explicit "committed until settled" guarantee.
Adversarial review of the report + its fix: the report is technically SOUND (verified: after a roll,
round_end moved so `cleared` is true while `aged` is false, and `!cleared && !aged` does not fire). Unlike
PR #27, the recommended fix is SAFE and not a trap: removing the `cleared` shortcut makes cancel STRICTER
(gate on `aged` alone) — it cannot open any hole (removing a cancel-escape only makes bids MORE committed),
cannot strand funds (`aged` always eventually fires), and `cleared` only ever mattered for rolled bids
anyway (settled bids are already rejected by SL_SETTLED). Cost: a rolled bid waits ~1 extra round to cancel.
FIX APPLIED (twap-program/src/lib.rs process_cancel_bid): dropped the round_end-delta `cleared` shortcut;
cancel now gates on `aged` (2*round_length) alone (eviction by a strictly-better bid remains the only other
early exit). Re-pointed the test: `e2e_roll_opens_the_cleared_cancel_path` -> `e2e_roll_does_not_unlock_
cancel_before_aging` — same setup, but now asserts the post-roll cancel is REJECTED and only succeeds after
the full aging window (escrow returned). Full chain suite 65/65 green; the aged-path + settled-bid + anti-
spoof cancel tests all still pass. INVARIANT: a bid is committed until SETTLED or 2*round_length aged (or
evicted by a strictly-better bid); a round_end change from a no-op roll must NOT count as a release.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] Init-validation negative-half sweep — remaining untested clauses are marginal
Build health: re-ran `cargo build-sbf` for all four programs — clean. Then swept the init/validation guards
for more "negative half untested because the test helper can't make the bad input" gaps (the pattern that
caught the freeze-authority clause). The remaining untested negatives are all marginal and deliberately not
pinned:
- distribution init_config `total_supply == 0` / `claim_window_slots == 0` (one line): obvious input-sanity.
  A 0 window would make the whole distribution burn-only (claim window closes at seal); but it is a setup
  value the orchestration controls, fail-fast-rejected, and a single missed config line, not an exploit.
- subledger accept_operator on a NON-insurance (own-vault) pool: rejected by `is_insurance()` AND would fail
  the percolator CPI anyway (default market_slab) — doubly-defended, non-sharp.
- distribution claim `recipient.is_signer`: enforces the pull model, but removing it causes NO LOF (funds
  still go to the recipient's recorded ATA, never an attacker) — low value.
- seal_winner / register `entry_count == 0`: register already blocks an empty proposal up front, so the
  seal-side check is an unreachable backstop (doubly-defended).
Verdict: the init-validation surface's high-value negatives are now pinned (mintable + freezable + supply,
finding-AA authority bind, finding-AI prefund, finding-AJ reinit); the residue is sanity/double-defense. No
new test (would be marginal/tautological), no test deleted, build-sbf clean, full suite green at 134.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] COIN-authority safety chain — enforced once (distribution), inherited everywhere
Follow-up to the freeze-authority pin below: audited whether ANY other program needs its own non-mintable/
non-freezable check on the genesis COIN. It does not — the safety is enforced at the single custody point and
inherited structurally:
1. distribution init_config is the enforcement point: rejects a live mint authority (pre-mint dilution) AND a
   live freeze authority (vault-freeze brick) AND `mint.supply != total_supply` (COIN held outside the pool).
   All three clauses are now tested (mint -> init_config_rejects_a_mintable_coin incl. the supply>total case;
   freeze -> init_config_rejects_a_freezable_coin, this run). So the genesis COIN is provably fixed-supply +
   unfreezable + fully in the vault.
2. The TWAP auction does NOT re-check the COIN's authorities — and does not need to: place_bid pins
   `bidder_src.mint == coin_mint == config.coin_mint` (lib.rs:42-61), so bidders MUST hold exactly the bound
   COIN; the auction's COIN therefore IS the genesis COIN and inherits (1). A parasite twap config bound to a
   different (mintable/freezable) COIN cannot drain real insurance — its config-derived twap_authority is not
   the percolator operator (finding AQ) — so it is inert.
3. The SUBLEDGER intentionally has no mint/freeze-authority check: its deposit asset is the collateral
   stablecoin (e.g. USDC), which is freezable BY DESIGN (the issuer can freeze) — a standard, accepted
   property, NOT the governance COIN. The COIN never touches the subledger.
Verdict: the non-mintable + non-freezable + full-supply invariants are enforced exactly once (distribution)
and inherited by the twap via the place_bid mint pin + finding AQ; no redundant twap/subledger-side check is
warranted. No code change, no test added.

### [BLOCKED] distribution init_config — a freezable COIN could brick every claim (freeze-authority clause)
Vector: the distributed COIN IS the MetaDAO. If a distribution were created against a COIN with a live FREEZE
authority, that authority (the deployer) could (a) FREEZE the distribution VAULT — the config PDA can then
never transfer out, so EVERY claim reverts and the whole genesis payout is permanently bricked (DOS), or
(b) freeze an individual recipient's account to block their claim. init_config rejects such a COIN.
Analysis (distribution/src/lib.rs init_config:40): `if mint.mint_authority.is_some() ||
mint.freeze_authority.is_some() { return Err }`. The mint-authority clause stops the pre-mint-dilution attack
(separately tested); the FREEZE clause stops the freeze-brick. BLOCKED.
Coverage gap closed: `init_config_rejects_a_mintable_coin` exercises only the MINT-authority clause — the test
helper `create_mint` initializes mints with `None` freeze authority, so the freeze clause was never hit. Added
`init_config_rejects_a_freezable_coin` (distribution/tests/distribution.rs): a COIN with the mint authority
REVOKED + supply == total_supply + vault funded but a LIVE freeze authority -> init rejected (the freeze
authority is the only thing left to fail on, so it isolates that clause). MUTATION-VERIFIED against the real
.so: deleting `|| mint.freeze_authority.is_some()` makes init ACCEPT the freezable COIN and the test FAILS
(sharp single-guard). KEPT. INVARIANT: init_config must reject BOTH a live mint authority AND a live freeze
authority — a fixed, non-freezable COIN is what makes the distribution unbrickable.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] Cross-program byte-offset coupling — all readers pinned (finding-T family audit)
Audited every place a program reads a FOREIGN struct by raw byte offset (the finding-T risk class):
- twap reads asset-0 `insurance` from the percolator slab at INSURANCE_OFFSET=448+301=749. PINNED by its OWN
  canary `insurance_offset_matches_real_percolator_slab` (chain.rs:1279): `offset_of!(MarketGroupV16HeaderAccount,
  insurance)` against the REAL percolator binary + `assert_ne!(vault, insurance)`. This canary is REQUIRED
  because the e2e hand-edits slab[749] (edit + read both at 749 would agree even if the field moved); the
  canary catches a sibling-percolator layout drift the e2e cannot.
- subledger reads the same slab `insurance` — PINNED by its own canary (insurance_percolator.rs:352, impair_market):
  offset_of! for insurance/vault/budget-remaining. Independent of the twap canary (separate program).
- genesis-vote reads the subledger Position (pool[8..40], owner[40..72], principal[72..80], start_slot[89..97])
  and Pool (outstanding[80..88], vote_authority[160..192]) by hardcoded offsets. VERIFIED all six match the REAL
  subledger struct (subledger:239-245 Position, :179-204 Pool). No separate canary needed: the gv↔subledger e2e
  (chain.rs full genesis) drives REAL subledger deposits/positions, so an offset drift makes the weight/quorum
  wrong and the e2e fails — unlike the hand-edited percolator case, this coupling's e2e genuinely catches drift.
Verdict: every raw-offset foreign read is either canaried against the real struct (the two percolator readers,
where the e2e can't catch drift) or e2e-validated with real data (gv->subledger). No gap, no test added.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] place_bid state guard / remaining-account smuggling / capped-pull conservation
Three probes this tick, all resolve to existing coverage or by-design safety:
- place_bid rejects when `book.state != BOOK_STATE_OPEN` (lib.rs:39) so a bid can't be slipped into a SETTLED
  (mid-claim) book and mix with already-settled slots. The NEGATIVE is explicitly pinned: chain.rs:3686
  asserts `place_bid(...).is_err()` while the book is SETTLED ("book is settled — placing is blocked until it
  drains"), then bidding succeeds only after claims reopen it.
- Remaining-account smuggling: execute reads the SEND coin_sink via next_account_info ONLY when
  sink_mode==SINK_SEND, and pins it to book.coin_sink; BURN mode reads no trailing account. claim/trigger have
  fixed account lists. So extra/trailing accounts are never interpreted.
- Capped percolator pull: if WithdrawInsuranceLimited delivers C < burnable, execute's budget = the actual
  holding balance (C), and the unpulled `burnable - C` simply becomes next round's surplus. The ratchet stays
  consistent: reserved_floor' = reserved_floor + retained <= insurance - C = insurance' (since C <= burnable),
  so the floor never exceeds the live insurance. No loss, no over-protection.
Verdict: no new gap, no test added/deleted. Reachable surface saturated; the only OPEN items remain the two
off-harness orchestration invariants — the deposit-deadline (DESIGN-DOS below) and durable 1-week timelock.

### [DESIGN-DOS / ORCHESTRATION] Quorum griefing — depositing during the vote inflates `outstanding` to block the trigger
Vector (genesis finalization DOS): the permissionless trigger requires `total_voted_principal*2 > live_
outstanding` (genesis-vote/src/lib.rs:739, read LIVE from the subledger pool). insurance_deposit RAISES
`pool.outstanding_principal` (subledger/src/lib.rs:941) and has NO deposit deadline / phase / "voting closed"
gate — and "kickstart" (the design's deposit-close step) exists ONLY in the design memory, NOWHERE in the four
on-chain programs. So an attacker can deposit a non-voting stake DURING the vote/trigger phase to inflate
`outstanding` and push the quorum out of reach, blocking the winning proposal from ever sealing.
COST (cheap for close votes): to block, the attacker needs `D >= 2V - O` (V = voted principal, O = prior
outstanding). For a BARE majority (V ≈ O/2, so 2V ≈ O) that is `D ≈ 0+` — a tiny, front-running deposit flips
a 50.1% quorum. For a strong majority (V = 0.8 O) it costs `D ≈ 0.6 O`. The deposit is capital-at-risk but
WITHDRAWABLE (the attacker never votes, so never vote-locks), so the griefing is sustained + near-free for the
attacker on a close vote; they front-run each trigger attempt.
WHY NOT a clean on-chain fix: the LIVE read is DELIBERATE — `trigger_uses_live_pool_outstanding_not_stale_cache`
proves a frozen/stale-LOW snapshot lets a minority that voted early CAPTURE the distribution after honest
deposits grow the pool. So you cannot just snapshot `outstanding` (that regresses minority-capture); and
min(snapshot,live) regresses it too. The only correct fix is a DEPOSIT DEADLINE: close deposits before the
vote settles, after which `outstanding` can only DROP via exits (which legitimately lowers the bar) — exactly
the "kickstart" the design names but the code never implements. That deadline cannot live in the subledger
(it is a generic, reusable pool the MetaDAO has no authority over and that knows nothing of gv phases), so it
must be enforced by the genesis ORCHESTRATION (task #6, unbuilt) revoking/closing the pool's deposit path
before voting — the same off-harness gap the on-chain checks (now incl. the timelock-minimum FIX) cannot
fully cover.
Verdict: REAL DOS surface, not closeable by the four on-chain programs alone; flagged as a hard requirement
for the orchestration tool (must close deposits before the vote settles). No code change (a naive on-chain
snapshot would reopen the worse minority-capture LOF); no test added (a test here would assert the griefing
SUCCEEDS — a weakness-pin — and would need rewriting once the orchestration deadline lands; the mechanics are
certain from lib.rs:739 + :941). Escalated to the user.
BOUNDING (follow-up): the grief surface is exactly the QUORUM numerator and exactly the window [vote-open,
trigger]:
- MAJORITY side is NOT a new hole: denying a proposal its `support_weight*2 > total_cast_weight` by voting a
  decoy is the deliberate, already-tested winner-take-all DEADLOCK (`e2e_tied_weight_between_proposals_
  deadlocks_until_broken`), resolved by voters consolidating — AND it costs more, because casting that decoy
  weight VOTE-LOCKS the attacker's capital (cannot withdraw until retract), unlike the quorum-grief whose
  deposit never votes and stays withdrawable.
- TOP-UP variant (vote a tiny principal, then top up huge to inflate outstanding) works — insurance_deposit's
  re-deposit branch only blocks `withdrawn`, not `vote_locked` (subledger:887) — but is the SAME mechanism and
  strictly more expensive than the no-vote fresh deposit; subsumed.
- WINDOW is pre-handoff only: deposits close when the operator handoff revokes the pool's authority
  (`e2e_post_handoff_deposit_blocked_by_authority_revoke`), so the twap/auction phase is immune; the grief is
  confined to the pre-trigger voting window. This is exactly why the orchestration's deposit-deadline (close
  deposits BEFORE the vote settles, not at handoff which is AFTER the trigger) is the fix.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] twap init_book — instruction-level audit (book-squat / account-substitution surface closed)
Probed init_book as a book-squat vector: the AuctionBook (PDA ["twap_book", config]) holds the reserve,
round length, sink mode and coin_sink — squatting it with malicious params (reserve 0 -> whale drains the
surplus; hostile coin_sink -> bought COIN to the attacker) would be critical. Read every guard:
- Squads-gated: `require_squads_vault(squads_vault, &config)` at the TOP (before any token-account read), so a
  forged/unsigned vault is rejected before anything else. This is the SAME helper already pinned sharply by
  `e2e_attacker_cannot_lower_the_reserve_without_squads` (set_reserve) and the reconfigure missing-signer
  test — a dedicated init_book gating test would be redundant with those.
- coin_escrow + settlement_usd: each must be owned by the derived book-escrow PDA, correct mint, and
  amount == 0; holding must be owned by twap_authority + collateral mint. coin_mint == config.coin_mint.
- SEND coin_sink: rejected if == coin_escrow (finding AS, prevents the escrow->escrow self-loop) and must be
  coin-mint.
- book PDA derived from config; `data_len() != 0 -> AccountAlreadyInitialized` (reinit guard).
The amount==0 escrow checks are defense-in-depth only: the escrow/settlement/holding are FRESH accounts the
DAO creates (not PDAs an attacker can predict/pre-fund), so a pre-funded-escrow squat is not externally
reachable. Happy path is exercised by setup_auction in 60+ chain tests.
Verdict: no new gap, no new test (gate is pinned via the shared helper; the pre-fund check isn't externally
reachable), no test to delete.

### [BENIGN] Uniform-price clearing — does floor rounding let a seller extract value from the buyback? (no)
Vector: at clear, every filled bid sells `coin_i = floor(usd_i * cm/um)` COIN for `usd_i` USD, where cm/um is
the MARGINAL bid's rate P*. The floor rounds the COIN the seller delivers DOWN, so the protocol receives
slightly fewer COIN per USD than the exact P* — i.e. rounding favors the SELLER. Could a bidder farm this?
Analysis: the shortfall is at most 1 atom per filled bid (`floor` drops < 1 unit), and the auction fills at
most MAX_BIDS = 32 bids per round, so the protocol's worst-case "overpay" is ≤ 32 atoms of COIN per round —
for a 6-decimal COIN that is 0.000032 COIN, economically nil and not accumulable (one active bid per bidder,
one round per execute, the surplus budget caps total spend). The opposite direction (a bid too small to buy a
whole atom, coin_i == 0) is treated as UNFILLED with a full refund (the protocol never pays USD for 0 COIN —
see the finding-AE roll restore). So the floor is the SAFE rounding choice and the residual is bounded +
negligible. Covered by `e2e_uniform_price_partial_marginal_fill` (asserts the exact floored coin_i / refunds).
Also corrected a stale test-count in the checkpoint header (was 134, the breakdown sums to 133; full suite
re-run confirms 133). No new test, no code change.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] twap accept_operator + permissionless cranks — doubly-defended, no redundant test needed
Probed the operator-handoff and permissionless-crank surface this tick; all resolve to existing coverage:
- `twap accept_operator` (rotate the asset-0 insurance operator to twap_authority) is DOUBLY-DEFENDED: the
  twap gate requires `squads_vault.is_signer` AND `squads_vault.key == squads_default_vault(config.squads_
  multisig)` (forged/unsigned vault rejected at the twap), and it CPIs percolator UpdateAssetAuthority which
  INDEPENDENTLY enforces the market asset_admin. A mutation removing the twap key/signer check would NOT make
  a bypass succeed (percolator backstops), so a twap-side direct-bypass test is non-sharp AND redundant with
  the already-present subledger mirror `e2e_attacker_cannot_grant_operator_bypassing_squads` + the handoff
  timelock tests. Do not add one.
- Permissionless cranks (trigger/execute/claim/burn_unclaimed) each require a signer only to pay, and pin
  ALL effects to recorded/derived accounts (claim -> recorded canonical ATAs; execute -> config-bound slab/
  vault/holding/escrow; trigger -> pinned distribution_config/proposal; burn -> config vault+mint). No
  privileged state is reachable by the choice of cranker.
- execute ratchet (`reserved_floor += retained`) cannot overflow: reserved_floor starts u128::MAX (surplus
  saturating_sub -> 0 -> retained 0, no pull) until the DAO sets a real (<= insurance, u64-bounded) floor,
  after which retained <= surplus <= insurance keeps it u64-scale.
Verdict: no new gap, no new test (would be redundant/non-sharp), no test to delete. Reachable six-binary
surface remains saturated; recent NEW finds were the untested negative half of an existing guard (missing-
signer, weight-0 quorum, eviction redirect) or the one missing on-chain enforcement (timelock minimum, now
FIXED). The realistic residual risk is OFF this harness: the unbuilt local proposal-generation/orchestration
tool (task #6), the sole guarantor of correct multisig members/threshold and the genesis wiring the on-chain
checks cannot fully cover.

### [SCOPE] Timelock guarantee — enforced at bind, NOT durable; bind surface is complete (follow-up to the FIXED entry)
Two follow-ups to the init_config time_lock fix below, to bound exactly what the 1-week guarantee covers:
1. BIND SURFACE COMPLETE: init_config is the ONLY place the twap reads/binds a Squads multisig (sole
   SQUADS_MULTISIG_DISC + MIN_TIMELOCK_SECS site; squads_multisig is then immutable — it is folded into the
   config PDA seed). So there is no second, unchecked path that could bind a short-timelock multisig. The
   subledger pool init has no multisig at all (its vote_authority is the gv config, validated gv-side); it
   instead pins the canonical percolator insurance vault (F-VAULT: vault.mint==mint && vault.owner==
   perc_vault_authority(slab)), which transitively validates the slab. No sibling gap.
2. DURABILITY IS A GOVERNANCE PROPERTY, NOT A CODE GUARANTEE: the multisig's `time_lock` is enforced at
   bind, but Squads lets the `config_authority` (= the DAO) change multisig config (incl. time_lock) via a
   CONFIG instruction, which is NOT itself gated by the vault timelock. So the DAO can shorten its own
   window after the fact; require_squads_vault only checks the vault PDA identity, never the CURRENT
   time_lock. This is intentional and not a fixable code vuln (the twap cannot police Squads' own config
   authority, and the elected futarchy IS the config_authority). The 1-week window therefore protects
   depositors against NON-DAO actors and against a SLOW DAO that doesn't actively reconfigure — NOT against
   the futarchy deliberately collapsing its own timelock. Documented so future readers/auditors don't assume
   the on-chain check makes the window tamper-proof against the DAO itself.
Verdict: no new test (the bind point is already pinned by `twap_config_rejects_a_multisig_below_the_one_week_
timelock`; the durability limitation is by-design and not a guard to pin). No code change.

### [FIXED] twap init_config — bound a sub-1-week-timelock Squads multisig, voiding the depositor exit window
Vector: the security model is DAO -> Squads (1-week timelock) -> TWAP -> percolator insurance. The 1-week
delay is the depositor-protection window: time to react/exit before any insurance-affecting DAO action lands.
init_config bound a multisig and verified its owner, disc, and config_authority == the DAO — but NEVER its
`time_lock`. The timelock lives in the MULTISIG account, not the TWAP config, so a config bound to a 0/short-
timelock multisig (config_authority still = the DAO) would silently void the window: the DAO (or whoever set
up the genesis) could act on insurance instantly, leaving depositors no time to exit. The premise was trusted
to the (unbuilt, off-harness) orchestration tool rather than enforced on-chain.
Severity/reachability: not externally exploitable in the correctly-orchestrated flow (the legit config binds
the genesis 1-week multisig, and a parasite config can't drive the real operator — finding AQ). But it is a
real defense-in-depth hole: a buggy or hostile genesis deployer could bind a short-timelock multisig and the
TWAP would accept it, defeating the system's headline guarantee with nothing on-chain catching it.
FIX (twap-program/src/lib.rs init_config): read the multisig's on-chain `time_lock` (u32 @ [74..78], after
config_authority [40..72] + threshold u16 [72..74]) and reject `time_lock < MIN_TIMELOCK_SECS` (604_800 =
7 days). The byte offset is validated against the REAL Squads binary by the whole existing chain suite (all
64 prior tests create 1-week multisigs and still pass — a wrong offset would reject them). Added
`twap_config_rejects_a_multisig_below_the_one_week_timelock`: a 1-day-timelock multisig (config_authority =
DAO, all other links valid) is REFUSED; the same wiring with a 1-week timelock is accepted. MUTATION-VERIFIED:
removing the time_lock check makes the short-timelock bind succeed and the test FAILS (sharp). INVARIANT:
init_config must enforce the 1-week minimum on the bound multisig's on-chain time_lock; the config_authority
check alone does not guarantee the protection window.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] Auction comparator overflow + own-vault symmetry — probed, already closed
Creative probe this tick: the uniform-price auction ranks/clears bids with two comparators; an extreme
`usdc_atoms` could (a) overflow the RESERVE comparison to smuggle a below-reserve bid past the guard, or
(b) overflow the bid-vs-bid RANKING/eviction cross-multiply to mis-rank a garbage bid above legit ones
(evicting them / winning the budget for ~0 COIN). Traced to the actual code:
- `cmp_rate` (the reserve eligibility comparator) is the continued-fraction algorithm — pure div/mod, NO
  multiplication, overflow-safe even at u128::MAX (lib.rs unit test `cmp_rate(u128::MAX, 3, u128::MAX, 4)`).
  So the reserve cannot be bypassed by extreme magnitudes.
- `cmp_bid` (ranking/eviction) is a naive `coin_a * usdc_b` cross-multiply — but place_bid bounds BOTH
  coin_atoms AND usdc_atoms to u64 via `as_u64` (lib.rs ~26-27, finding AC: "subsumes the old
  coin_atoms*usdc_atoms overflow check"), so the product is u64*u64 < u128::MAX — no overflow. The u64
  bound is TESTED end-to-end: `e2e_*` (chain.rs:4069+, finding AC) rejects a `(u64::MAX as u128)+1` usdc bid.
- Own-vault pool path fully covered (subledger.rs: healthy/with-surplus/impaired-order-independent/
  non-owner-withdraw/vault-not-owned-by-pool); and BOTH deposit paths symmetrically reject re-deposit into a
  `withdrawn` position (insurance lib.rs:887, own-vault lib.rs:517) — no stranding asymmetry.
Verdict: no new gap. Reachable surface remains comprehensively covered; recent NEW pins have all been the
untested NEGATIVE half of an already-guarded boundary (missing-signer is_signer halves, weight-0 quorum,
eviction redirect). Recording the comparator-overflow analysis so it is not re-derived.

### [BLOCKED] genesis-vote vote — flash-deposit quorum pump via a weight-0 (too-recent) vote (Sybil timing)
Vector: vote weight = floor(log2(hold_age)) * principal, and a position with age < 2 has ZERO weight. The
vote handler rejects a weight-0 vote outright. That rejection is load-bearing because vote ADDS the position's
PRINCIPAL to config.total_voted_principal (the quorum numerator: total_voted_principal*2 > outstanding) right
AFTER the weight check. Hostile idea: deposit a large sum and vote in the SAME slot (age 0, weight 0). If the
weight-0 vote were accepted, the principal would still land in total_voted_principal — letting a last-second
flash deposit PUMP the quorum toward a premature trigger while contributing no time-weight at all.
Analysis (genesis-vote/src/lib.rs vote): `vote_weight(principal, age)` returns 0 for age < 2 (also avoids
ilog2(0)); then `if weight == 0 { return Err }` refuses the vote before any tally mutation. So a too-recent
position cannot vote and its principal never counts toward quorum. BLOCKED.
Coverage gap closed: the positive weight path (warp 1024 slots -> weight 10*principal) was exercised inside
the vote-lock tests, but the NEGATIVE (a too-recent position is refused AND credits no principal) had no test.
Added `a_too_recent_position_cannot_vote_or_pump_the_quorum` (subledger/tests/insurance_percolator.rs):
deposit then vote in the same slot -> rejected, proposal support stays (0,0); then warp to age 1024 and the
SAME position votes, crediting principal + weight 10*principal. MUTATION-VERIFIED against the real gv .so:
removing the `weight == 0` rejection lets the fresh vote succeed and credit its principal (support != 0) and
the test FAILS (sharp single-guard). KEPT. INVARIANT: vote must keep refusing weight-0 ballots BEFORE adding
principal to total_voted_principal — capital must sit at risk (age >= 2) before it can count toward quorum.

### [BLOCKED] distribution seal_winner — missing-signer seal of an attacker proposal (theft of the whole COIN supply)
Vector: seal_winner marks the WINNING proposal sealed; sealing is the gate to claiming the funded vault
(the entire fixed COIN supply). It gates on BOTH the authority's SIGNATURE and its key (== config.authority,
the gv config PDA in genesis). The canonical missing-signer risk: if it accepted a KEY match without a
signature, an attacker could NAME the real authority as a read-only account and seal an attacker-chosen
proposal with no authorization — then claim the whole supply. (The authority is a PDA in genesis, signing
ONLY via the gv trigger CPI, so is_signer is the line between "the vote authorized this seal" and "someone
merely named the vote".)
Analysis (distribution/src/lib.rs seal_winner): `!authority.is_signer -> MissingRequiredSignature` AND
`*authority.key != config.authority -> MissingRequiredSignature`. So a non-signing real authority and a
wrong signing key are both rejected. BLOCKED.
Coverage gap closed: the happy-path test's imposter case pins the KEY half (a wrong signer is rejected) but
NOT the is_signer half (the real authority named unsigned). Added
`seal_rejects_naming_the_authority_without_its_signature`: name the real authority as a read-only non-signer,
no one signs as it -> rejected, config.sealed_proposal stays default; then the genuine authority signing
still seals (guard is the signature, not a freeze). MUTATION-VERIFIED against the real .so: removing the
`!authority.is_signer` check lets the unsigned seal succeed and the test FAILS (sharp single-guard).
KEPT. INVARIANT: seal_winner must keep BOTH the authority is_signer and key checks — a config.authority KEY
match without its SIGNATURE is not authorization. (Same class as the reconfigure + set_vote_lock missing-
signer pins; this one guards the COIN-supply seal, the highest-stakes of the three.)

### [BLOCKED] subledger set_vote_lock — owner self-unlocking a live vote to exit capital (the core Sybil hole)
Vector: the whole bootstrap's Sybil resistance rests on "a vote can never outlive the capital backing it":
a live ballot vote-LOCKS the depositor's principal, and the lock is cleared ONLY by the gv vote-RETRACT CPI
(which also removes the ballot's weight/principal). set_vote_lock requires BOTH the owner AND the
vote_authority (gv config PDA) to sign. Hostile idea: the owner calls set_vote_lock(0) DIRECTLY on their own
position, NAMING the gv config as a read-only (unsigned) account — clearing the lock without retracting —
then withdraws their principal while the ballot stays live: a vote backed by capital no longer at risk.
Analysis (subledger/src/lib.rs process_set_vote_lock): `!vote_authority.is_signer -> MissingRequiredSignature`
(plus owner.is_signer, plus pool.vote_authority == vote_authority.key). The gv config PDA only signs via the
gv vote-retract CPI, so a bare owner cannot toggle the lock — the self-unlock is rejected. BLOCKED.
Coverage gap closed: `hostile_vote_authority_cannot_freeze_a_depositor` pins the OWNER-sig half (can't LOCK
a victim without their signature). `vote_locked_principal_cannot_exit_until_retracted` pins the withdraw-side
guard (locked -> can't exit). But the vote_authority-SIG half — owner can't SELF-UNLOCK — was untested. Added
`owner_cannot_self_unlock_a_live_vote_to_exit_capital`: alice votes (locks), then directly calls
set_vote_lock(0) naming the gv config UNSIGNED -> rejected, position stays locked, withdraw still refused,
capital still at risk. MUTATION-VERIFIED against the real .so: removing the `!vote_authority.is_signer` check
lets the self-unlock succeed and the test FAILS (sharp single-guard). KEPT. INVARIANT: set_vote_lock must keep
requiring BOTH the owner AND the vote_authority signatures — the lock toggles only inside the gv vote CPI,
never by the owner alone; a vote_authority KEY match without its SIGNATURE is not authorization.

### [BLOCKED] twap reconfigure — missing-signer bypass of the burn-share gate (Squads/timelock bypass DOS)
Vector: `reconfigure` (IX 2) changes the DAO's burn share (surplus_buy_burn_bps), Squads-vault-gated behind
the 1-week timelock. Unlike the other mutators it does NOT call require_squads_vault — it INLINES the gate.
The canonical Copenhagen "missing signer check" risk: if the inlined gate checked only the vault KEY and not
is_signer, an attacker could merely NAME the real Squads vault as a read-only (unsigned) account and
reconfigure the burn policy freely — bypassing the DAO AND the entire 1-week timelock (governance-capture
DOS: force bps to 0 to kill the buyback, or 100% to route all surplus to burn with no retention).
Analysis (twap-program/src/lib.rs process_reconfigure): it checks BOTH `!squads_vault.is_signer ->
MissingRequiredSignature` AND `*squads_vault.key != squads_default_vault(config.squads_multisig) ->
IllegalOwner`. So a non-signing real vault and a forged signing key are both rejected. BLOCKED.
Coverage gap closed: the existing `reconfigure_only_via_squads_vault_execute_after_timelock` covers only the
TIMELOCK negative (execute-before-elapsed), exercising the gate via a proper Squads execute — it never tries
a DIRECT reconfigure with a non-signing or forged vault. Added `e2e_reconfigure_rejects_a_non_signing_or_
forged_vault`: (1) reference the real vault as a NON-signer -> rejected (is_signer); (2) attacker signs as
their own key posing as the vault -> rejected (key); bps stays 8000 in both. MUTATION-VERIFIED against the
real .so: removing the `!squads_vault.is_signer` check lets attack (1) succeed (bps -> 0) and the test FAILS
(sharp single-guard on the missing-signer class). KEPT. INVARIANT: reconfigure's inlined gate must keep BOTH
the is_signer and canonical-vault-key checks; an authority KEY match without a SIGNATURE is not authorization.
This completes the config-mutator auth coverage: set_reserved_floor, set_reserve, set_coin_sink, shutdown,
reconfigure all now have a direct non-Squads rejection test.

### [BLOCKED] twap set_reserve — non-Squads caller lowering the reserve to drain the surplus (auth-bypass LOF)
Vector: the auction reserve rate is the DAO's guard against a whale's expensive (low-rate) bid dragging the
uniform clearing price down and making the protocol overpay (see e2e_reserve_blocks_expensive_bid_from_
draining_surplus). `set_reserve` (IX 6) is Squads-vault-gated. Hostile idea: a plain attacker calls set_reserve
directly — posing as the Squads vault — to LOWER a protective reserve to 0/1 (accept ANY bid), re-exposing
the whole surplus to be drained for ~1 COIN at a terrible clearing price.
Analysis (twap-program/src/lib.rs process_set_reserve): `require_squads_vault(squads_vault, &config)` demands
the signer (a) be a signer AND (b) equal `squads_default_vault(config.squads_multisig)` — the config's
canonical Squads vault, reachable only via a Squads execute. A plain attacker key fails (b) -> IllegalOwner.
BLOCKED.
Coverage gap closed: the cross-config test `e2e_config_a_cannot_mutate_config_bs_book_reserve` rejects via the
`book.config` pin (a foreign config can't touch this book) — it does NOT exercise the require_squads_vault
SIGNER gate (the foreign vault IS its own config's vault). The DIRECT non-Squads set_reserve had no test
(unlike set_reserved_floor, which has `e2e_attacker_cannot_lower_surplus_floor_without_squads`). Added
`e2e_attacker_cannot_lower_the_reserve_without_squads`: DAO sets a protective 2/1 reserve via Squads, then a
plain attacker posing as the vault tries to lower it to 0/1 -> rejected, reserve stays 2/1. MUTATION-VERIFIED
against the real .so: removing require_squads_vault from process_set_reserve lets the attacker's set succeed
(reserve -> 0/1) and the test FAILS. KEPT (sharp single-guard). INVARIANT: every twap config mutator
(set_reserve / set_reserved_floor / set_coin_sink / reconfigure) must keep require_squads_vault; the
book.config pin alone does NOT gate the signer.

### [BLOCKED] genesis-vote init_config — re-initializing a live config to wipe the vote tallies (reinit DOS)
Vector: init_config is permissionless. If an already-initialized gv config could be re-initialized, the
second init would RESET the global tallies (total_voted_principal / total_cast_weight / outstanding) to 0
while every voter's ballot PDA + subledger vote-lock persists — desyncing the genesis: it could never reach
quorum again (permanent DOS) and an in-flight winning vote would be silently wiped.
Analysis: BLOCKED by TWO independent layers — (1) the `data_len() != 0 -> AccountAlreadyInitialized` gate
at the top of init_config, and (2) the robust `create_pda` (allocate + assign via invoke_signed require a
SYSTEM-owned, data-empty account; after the first init the config is PROGRAM-owned, so allocate fails). So
re-init is doubly refused. Verified via mutation: even with the data_len gate removed, the create_pda
backstop still rejects the second init (the test stays green) — i.e. neither guard alone is a single point
of failure.
Coverage gap closed: the reinit-DOS was tested for the subledger pool (`insurance_pool_cannot_be_reinitialized_
after_funding`, finding AJ) but not for the gv governance config. Added `gv_config_cannot_be_reinitialized_to_
wipe_a_vote` (genesis-vote/tests/seal.rs): with a quorum+majority vote in progress, a second init_gv is
rejected and the vote then triggers + seals exactly as before (tally intact). KEPT — pins the outcome (a live
governance config can't be reset) end-to-end; defense-in-depth means a single-guard regression won't silently
reopen it. INVARIANT: init_config must keep the data_len re-init gate AND the system-owned-account robust
create; do not let either become the sole guard.

### [BLOCKED] twap place_bid eviction — redirecting the evicted bidder's escrowed COIN to the attacker (LOF)
Vector: when the book is full, a STRICTLY-better incoming bid evicts the weakest and must refund the
evictee's escrowed COIN. The incoming bidder passes the evict refund account as the trailing account.
Hostile idea: pass an attacker-controlled COIN account instead of the evictee's account, so the eviction
refund (the evictee's full escrow) lands in the attacker's hands — stealing a stranger's committed COIN
while taking their book slot.
Analysis (twap-program/src/lib.rs place_bid, ~1188-1207): the refund target is pinned to the weakest bid's
RECORDED `SL_COIN_ATA` (set to the evictee's CANONICAL COIN ATA at THEIR own place_bid, ~1243), and the
passed evict account must equal it exactly (`*evict_acct.key != evicted_ata -> InvalidAccountData`, ~1197).
So a mismatched/attacker account reverts the whole placement; the evictee's COIN can only ever go to the
evictee's canonical ATA (permissionlessly recreatable, finding V/AB). BLOCKED.
Coverage gap closed: the eviction HAPPY path (refund to the correct canonical ATA) and the not-better-bid
rejection were tested in `e2e_full_book_evicts_only_for_a_strictly_better_bid`, but the adversarial
REDIRECT was not. Extended that test (reusing its 32-bid full book — no duplicate setup): the better bidder
first tries to evict while redirecting the refund to a fresh attacker COIN account -> rejected, attacker
account stays 0, the evictee's COIN stays escrowed, the escrow total is untouched, and the attacker's own
bid COIN was NOT escrowed (tx reverted); then the HONEST eviction (correct canonical target) succeeds.
MUTATION-VERIFIED against the real .so: removing the `evict_acct.key != evicted_ata` pin makes the redirect
SUCCEED (attacker gets the COIN) and the test FAIL. KEPT (extended, no new test). INVARIANT: place_bid must
keep pinning the eviction refund to the weakest bid's recorded canonical SL_COIN_ATA; never refund to a
caller-supplied account.

### [BLOCKED] distribution init_config — lamport-prefund DOS on the config that custodies the COIN supply (finding AI)
Vector: the dist config PDA is deterministic (f(coin_mint, authority), both public) and init_config is
permissionless. System `create_account` aborts with AccountAlreadyInUse on ANY pre-existing lamports, so an
attacker can transfer 1 lamport to the config PDA (no signature needed) BEFORE the orchestrator inits it,
and the dust can never be swept from a system-owned PDA. With plain create_account this PERMANENTLY bricks
the distribution config that custodies the ENTIRE COIN supply (no config -> the funded vault can never be
sealed/claimed -> the genesis payout is frozen). Analysis: init_config's `create_pda_robust` (top-up +
allocate + assign via invoke_signed; re-init gated on data_len, not lamports) tolerates the dust. BLOCKED.
Coverage gap closed: the same prefund-DOS was tested for the subledger pool, twap book, and (prior tick) gv
config inits — this completes the set with the distribution config init, the account that holds the COIN
supply. Added `lamport_prefund_cannot_brick_config_init` (distribution/tests/distribution.rs): dust the PDA,
init STILL succeeds, the config is program-owned with data, and a proposal registers under it (valid state,
not a half-allocated husk). MUTATION-VERIFIED against the real .so: swapping create_pda_robust for plain
create_account makes the dusted init fail and the test fail. KEPT. All four permissionless-init PDAs across
the stack now have a prefund-DOS regression test; INVARIANT unchanged (robust create + data_len re-init gate).

### [BLOCKED] genesis-vote init_config — lamport-prefund DOS on the genesis governance config (finding AI)
Vector: the gv config PDA is deterministic (f(coin_mint, subledger_pool), both public) and init_config is
permissionless. System `create_account` aborts with AccountAlreadyInUse on ANY pre-existing lamports, so an
attacker can transfer 1 lamport to the gv config PDA (a transfer needs NO destination signature) BEFORE the
orchestrator inits it — and the dust can never be swept from a system-owned PDA. If init used plain
create_account this would PERMANENTLY brick the genesis GOVERNANCE config (no config -> no voting/trigger ->
the whole genesis stalls). Analysis: gv's `create_pda` is robust (finding AI) — top-up the rent shortfall
with a plain transfer, then allocate + assign via invoke_signed (both only require data-empty + system-owned,
true for a merely pre-funded address); callers gate re-init on `data_len()!=0`, not lamports. So it tolerates
the dust. BLOCKED.
Coverage gap closed: the same prefund-DOS was tested for the subledger pool init
(`lamport_prefund_cannot_brick_insurance_pool_init`) and the twap book init
(`e2e_lamport_prefund_cannot_brick_book_init`), but NOT for the gv config init (nor the distribution config
init — same class, still untested, candidate for a later tick). Added `lamport_prefund_cannot_brick_gv_config_init`
(genesis-vote/tests/seal.rs): dust the gv config PDA with 1 lamport, then init_gv STILL succeeds, the config is
owned-by-program with data, and a real proposal registers + seals (genesis proceeds normally).
MUTATION-VERIFIED against the real .so: swapping create_pda for plain create_account makes the dusted init
fail and the test fail. KEPT. INVARIANT: every permissionless genesis-path init must keep using the robust
create (top-up + allocate + assign) and gate re-init on data_len, never lamports.

### [BLOCKED] twap execute roll — phantom-claim after a marginal-zero-coin fill (finding-AE restore, anti-spoof bypass)
Vector: `execute` is a "roll" (nothing bought) when total_coin==0. There are TWO ways that happens:
(a) budget==0 (surplus below floor) — `marginal` is never set, the settle loop is skipped; (b) budget>0
but every fill rounds to coin_i==0 (a sub-atom fill at a low bid rate). In case (b) the settle loop ALREADY
ran and wrote SL_SETTLED=1 + SL_COIN_REFUND=full on the slot BEFORE total_coin==0 forces the roll. The
finding-AE restore (lib.rs ~1505) MUST reset SETTLED/COIN_REFUND/USD_OWED. If it didn't, the bid is left
phantom-SETTLED with a full refund → claim (which gates on the SLOT's SL_SETTLED, NOT the book state) would
pay the bidder their whole escrow back immediately — a FREE exit of a committed bid with no cancel cooldown
(anti-spoof bypass) + a drain of the shared coin_escrow. Analysis: the restore resets all three fields, so
the rolled bid is byte-identical to pre-execute and claim refuses it (SL_SETTLED==0). BLOCKED.
Coverage gap closed: the existing roll test (`e2e_roll_with_committed_bid_settles_correctly_next_round`)
triggers the roll via budget==0 — case (a), where `marginal` is never set, so the restore is a NO-OP and
the SETTLED=1→0 reset is never exercised. Added
`e2e_roll_with_a_marginal_zero_coin_fill_leaves_no_phantom_claim` (reserve 0/1; a 1-COIN-for-1000-USD bid;
surplus forced to 0 so NO percolator CPI; holding hand-seeded with 5 USD → marginal IS set, coin_i=floor(5/1000)=0
→ roll through the restore). Asserts: no burn, nothing parked, budget rolls over, escrow intact, the rolled
bid is NOT claimable (the guard), and a next round with a real 1000-USD budget settles + burns it correctly.
MUTATION-VERIFIED against the real .so: disabling the restore loop makes the phantom claim SUCCEED and the
test FAIL (so it pins case (b), which budget==0 cannot). KEPT. INVARIANT: a roll (total_coin==0) must reset
SL_USD_OWED/COIN_REFUND/SETTLED on every occupied slot; claim must keep gating on the slot's SL_SETTLED.

### [BLOCKED] twap claim — replaying a settled slot to drain other winners' parked USD (double-spend LOF)
Vector: after `execute`, every winner's `usd_owed` is parked together in ONE shared settlement-USD account
and pulled per-slot by the permissionless `claim`. Hostile idea: claim a settled slot, then call `claim`
on the SAME slot again — each replay pays `usd_owed` (+ `coin_refund`) once more out of the shared pool,
draining the OTHER winners' parked payouts (a direct LOF against co-winners).
Analysis (twap-program/src/lib.rs process_claim): claim requires `SL_OCCUPIED==1 && SL_SETTLED==1`
(line ~48), pays out, then ZEROES the slot (`*b = 0`, line ~71) clearing SL_OCCUPIED — so a second claim
sees OCCUPIED==0 and is refused. BLOCKED. (Cancel-vs-claim double-spend is separately blocked by
`e2e_cancel_cannot_double_spend_a_settled_bid`.)
Coverage gap closed: the happy-path `e2e_buy_burn_uniform_price_dutch_auction` claims each slot ONCE but
never replays — and there every winner claims, draining the pool to 0, so a replay would fail on pool
EXHAUSTION even if the slot-zero guard regressed (it didn't isolate the guard). Added
`e2e_claim_cannot_be_replayed_to_drain_other_winners`: two SYMMETRIC bidders (400k COIN/200k USD each)
clear at P*=2, settlement parks 400k = two equal 200k shares; alice claims slot 0 once, then a REPLAY of
slot 0 is refused while bob's 200k is still parked (so only the slot-zero guard can block it, not
exhaustion); alice never double-collects; bob then claims his intact share. KEPT — pins the claim
double-spend with the pool deliberately still funded. INVARIANT: process_claim must keep gating on
SL_OCCUPIED/SL_SETTLED and zeroing the slot after payout; never pay a slot whose OCCUPIED flag is clear.

### [VERIFIED-COVERED] Sweep tick — seven boundaries probed, each already pinned by a named test (no new test, no redundancy)
A breadth tick: picked seven plausible LOF/DOS vectors across the repo and traced each to the ACTUAL
code + the existing test that pins it. All BLOCKED and already covered — recording the vector→test map so
future iterations don't re-derive them.
1. Subledger haircut SEQUENTIAL conservation (finding L): two depositors racing to exit an impaired pool,
   rounding (mul_div_floor) must not let Σ payouts exceed the vault or strand the late exiter. Covered by
   `impaired_insurance_exit_is_pro_rata` (Alice+Bob both exit a 50%-impaired pool, order-independent, vault
   fully/fairly distributed → 0). floor is the safe direction (each payout ≤ exact share). Unit values in
   `principal_policy_impaired_is_pro_rata`.
2. Subledger accept_operator authority-bypass: accept_operator is permissionless but hardcodes the new
   authority to the pool's own PDA and relies on percolator UpdateAssetAuthority to require the real
   asset_admin (Squads vault) co-sign. Covered by `e2e_attacker_cannot_grant_operator_bypassing_squads`
   (forged asset_admin → percolator rejects) + `percolator_update_asset_authority_operator_encoding_is_accepted`
   (random key can't hijack the operator).
3. Finding-O floor zero-pull: execute pulls `saturating_sub(insurance, reserved_floor)` so insurance ≤ floor
   pulls nothing. Covered by `e2e_execute_pulls_nothing_when_insurance_below_floor` (the == boundary is the
   same saturating branch).
4. Distribution claim AFTER the window closes (`slot >= window_end`): a late claimer must not pull before a
   burn cranker runs. Covered by `unclaimed_is_burned_after_window` ("window closed" claim rejection +
   unclaimed burned). claim/burn share an exact `window_end` boundary (no race).
5. TWAP book-stuffing DOS: one identity filling all MAX_BIDS slots to crowd out bidders / skew the marginal
   clearing price. place_bid rejects a bidder who already occupies a slot (lib.rs:1149, no self-replace).
   Covered by the chain.rs auction test ("a bidder cannot stack a second bid").
6. TWAP shutdown scope: shutdown is Squads-gated and limited to sweeping the holding. Covered by
   `e2e_shutdown_sweeps_holding_only_via_squads` (non-DAO rejected) + `e2e_shutdown_cannot_drain_escrow_or_settlement`
   (even the DAO can't redirect it at the COIN escrow / settlement-USD).
7. GV quorum/tally desync: total_voted_principal counts only LIVE ballots (retract decrements it; exit needs
   retract first via the vote-lock), and trigger re-reads live outstanding. Structurally tight (checked
   arithmetic + `trigger_uses_live_pool_outstanding_not_stale_cache` + `vote_locked_principal_cannot_exit_until_retracted`).
Verdict: reachable six-binary surface remains comprehensively covered; the only untested-boundary finds this
session have been in the under-probed distribution/genesis-vote programs (3 added in prior ticks). Highest-value
remaining targets stay OFF this harness (the unbuilt local proposal-generation tool; the rewards-program monolith).

### [BLOCKED] genesis-vote register_proposal — non-creator front-run freezing a stale snapshot (griefing DOS)
Vector: `register_proposal` is permissionless and creates the UNIQUE gv_proposal PDA `f(config,
dist_proposal)`, freezing a `(entry_count, total_amount)` SNAPSHOT that `trigger` later requires to match
the live distribution proposal EXACTLY (the anti-bait-and-switch guard, lib.rs:720-729). Hostile idea: a
griefer front-runs an honest creator and registers the creator's PARTIALLY-built distribution proposal —
seizing the only gv_proposal PDA (the creator then can't re-register: data_len != 0 -> AccountAlready-
Initialized) AND freezing a stale snapshot. The creator's remaining appends make the live proposal's
(entry_count, total_amount) diverge from the frozen snapshot, so trigger rejects forever -> the victim's
distribution can NEVER be sealed/win. Pure DOS, no capital needed.
Analysis (genesis-vote/src/lib.rs register_proposal, line 470-473): register reads the distribution
proposal's `creator` (header [48..80]) and requires `creator == *payer.key`. So only the proposal's own
creator can register it — they do so once it is COMPLETE — and a front-runner is rejected with IllegalOwner.
BLOCKED.
Coverage gap closed: the APPEND creator-binding (distribution lib.rs:417) was tested
(`e2e_non_creator_cannot_append_to_a_proposal`, `append_entries_rejects_a_foreign_creator`) and the
append bait-and-switch snapshot was tested (`e2e_bait_and_switch_appended_entries_cannot_be_sealed`), but
the REGISTER creator-binding — a DISTINCT guard against the snapshot-freeze griefing DOS — had no test.
Added `register_rejects_a_non_creator_front_runner` (genesis-vote/tests/seal.rs): an attacker cannot
register the victim's proposal; the genuine creator then registers AND the proposal seals end-to-end
(proving the PDA was never seized). KEPT — pins a distinct DOS boundary. INVARIANT: register_proposal must
keep binding `dist_proposal.creator == payer`; never make register fully permissionless, or any in-flight
proposal can be snapshot-frozen by a front-runner and bricked.

### [BLOCKED] distribution claim — a LOSING proposal draining the winner's shared vault (cross-proposal isolation)
Vector: the genesis votes among SEVERAL candidate COIN distributions, all registered as proposals under
ONE distribution config that owns ONE funded vault (= full COIN supply). Only the winner is sealed.
Hostile idea: register a self-dealing LOSING proposal that allocates the ENTIRE supply to the attacker;
after an honest proposal wins, claim from the attacker's losing proposal against the shared vault — a
direct drain of the winner's funds.
Analysis (distribution/src/lib.rs claim, line 518): claim binds `config.sealed_proposal == *proposal.key`
(plus `is_sealed()`), so only the single sealed (winning) proposal can ever pay; a losing proposal's claim
is refused with InvalidAccountData. seal is also one-shot (`config.is_sealed()` guard at :470), so the
loser can't be re-sealed to redirect the vault. BLOCKED.
Coverage gap closed: the single-proposal claim guards (no-claim-before-seal, non-authority seal,
double-claim, wrong-recipient) were all tested, but every existing claim test used ONE proposal — the
cross-proposal vault isolation (the real multi-candidate genesis shape) had no test. Added
`a_losing_proposal_cannot_claim_the_winners_vault` (distribution/tests/distribution.rs): winner (100→alice)
+ a full-supply self-dealing loser (100→mallory) share one config/vault; seal the winner; mallory's claim
from the loser is refused, resealing the loser is refused, mallory gets 0, and alice claims the full,
untouched 100. KEPT — pins the cross-proposal isolation (distinct from the single-proposal guards).
INVARIANT: claim must keep binding `config.sealed_proposal == proposal` and seal must stay one-shot; never
let a non-winning proposal reach the vault.

### [BLOCKED] distribution append_entries — foreign creator injecting a self-dealing entry (theft of headroom)
Vector: a distribution proposal is a candidate COIN distribution list; once its winner is sealed, every
entry becomes directly claimable by the named recipient. `create_proposal`/`append_entries` are
permissionless (anyone can sign). Hostile idea: while an honest creator's proposal is still in-flight
(not sealed) and has unallocated headroom (`total_amount < total_supply`), front-run/append a self-entry
to it — then the moment that proposal wins the genesis vote and is sealed, CLAIM the injected COIN. The
total-supply cap (lib.rs:442) does NOT catch this because the injection fits in the headroom.
Analysis (distribution/src/lib.rs append_entries, line 417): the proposal records its `creator` at
create time, and append enforces `header.creator == *creator.key` (plus `header.sealed`/`config.is_sealed`
gates at :420). So only the original creator can extend a proposal; a foreign signer is rejected with
InvalidAccountData. BLOCKED.
Coverage gap closed: the cap negative (`append_cannot_exceed_total_supply`) and seal/claim/burn paths were
tested, but the append creator-binding had NO negative test. Added `append_entries_rejects_a_foreign_creator`
(distribution/tests/distribution.rs): honest creator seeds 40/100; an attacker (own signer, creator slot)
tries to inject a 60-COIN self-entry into the headroom → rejected; the genuine creator then appends into
the same headroom successfully (binding is to the creator, not a freeze). KEPT — pins a direct LOF guard.
INVARIANT: append_entries must keep enforcing `header.creator == signer` and the not-sealed gate; never
make append permissionless, or a winning proposal could be poisoned with attacker entries before seal.

### [BLOCKED] gv init_config — front-run squat binding a foreign/unsealable distribution config (finding H negative)
Vector: `genesis-vote::init_config` is permissionless (only the payer signs) and the gv config PDA seed
binds `[gv_config, coin_mint, subledger_pool]` (finding R) — but the `distribution_config` it wires is a
STORED field, NOT in the seed. Hostile idea: front-run the honest orchestrator's init_config and bind the
genesis to a DISTRIBUTION the attacker controls (or one for a different coin), so the winner-take-all
trigger seals the wrong distribution (hijack the COIN payout) or seals one whose authority ≠ this config
(trigger's seal CPI reverts on authority mismatch → finalize bricked → DOS).
Analysis (genesis-vote/src/lib.rs init_config, lines 39-44): the wired distribution_config is validated
HARD at bind time — `owner == distribution_program`, disc `DISTCFG1`, `dc[8..40] (coin) == coin_mint`,
and `dc[72..104] (seal authority) == expected` (THIS gv config PDA). Combined with the distribution's own
seed binding its authority (finding P/AA: `dist_config = f(coin, authority)`) and the funded-vault
requirement (finding E: vault ≥ total_supply of the fixed-supply COIN), the ONLY distribution that
satisfies `authority == gv PDA` is the real one whose vault already holds the COIN — which the attacker
cannot forge (can't obtain the COIN; mint revoked). So the squat is structurally BLOCKED: a foreign
distribution fails the authority/coin check at init; a "correct" one can't be funded.
Coverage gap closed: the parallel POOL-binding negative was tested (`init_config_rejects_pool_not_bound_*`,
`gv_config_cannot_be_bound_to_a_substituted_pool`) but the DISTRIBUTION-binding negative was NOT. Added
`init_config_rejects_a_distribution_not_authority_bound_to_this_config` (genesis-vote/tests/seal.rs):
plants a fully-valid-looking dist config (right owner/disc/vault) with (a) right coin but attacker seal
authority → rejected, (b) right authority (gv PDA) but a different coin → rejected, then accepts the real
authority+coin-bound distribution (boundary is EXACT, not a blanket reject). KEPT — pins finding H's
distribution-side binding, which had no negative test. INVARIANT: init_config must keep validating BOTH
`dist.coin == coin_mint` AND `dist.authority == this gv config PDA`; never drop either, else the genesis
could be wired to a distribution it cannot seal (DOS) or one paying a different coin (hijack).

### [REVIEW] External PR/issue adversarial review (DPRK lens) — regression-inducing "fix" caught + rejected
Reviewed the only open GitHub items under a nation-state-adversary lens (subtle backdoors, supply-chain
swaps, social-engineered "fixes" that weaken existing guards). Issue #26 (`SrMessiSOL`) was a genuine
external report of finding AD (one `twap_authority` shared across configs with different percolator
programs). PR #27 "Bind TWAP authority PDA to Percolator program" fixed it at the AD level —
`["market-0-twap", market, percolator_program]` — but master had ALREADY superseded that with the
config-binding (finding AQ, `["market-0-twap", config]`, commit 939078f). So PR #27 was a
REGRESSION TRAP, not an implant: merging it would DOWNGRADE the seed to a weaker (perc-only) binding,
reopening the CRITICAL parasite-config insurance drain (a parasite config on the victim's market, own
squads/coin, `reserved_floor = 0`, sharing the operator PDA). Confirmed empirically this tick: reverting
the 4 signer sites to PR #27's market_slab-bound seed makes `e2e_parasite_config_on_same_market_cannot_drain_insurance`
FAIL — so that test is the standing CI regression guard. Worse, PR #27's branch was stale (referenced
the removed `pull_surplus`) and its `chain.rs` predated the parasite test, so the merge would have
CLOBBERED the very guard. Scanned the full diff: NO Cargo/lock/CI/build.rs changes (no supply-chain
swap), no removed signer/owner/seed checks, no `unsafe`/fs/net — a stale, correct-but-superseded fix
whose only effect on master is a downgrade. VERDICT: closed PR #27 (superseded, regression warning) and
issue #26 (fixed by AQ) on GitHub. INVARIANT: the twap_authority seed MUST stay config-bound
(`["market-0-twap", config]`); never re-weaken it to `[market, percolator_program]` or `[market]`.

### [STATE] Canonical-ATA refund recoverability (finding-V class) — complete across all 3 refund paths
The auction returns escrowed COIN on three paths; a stuck (closed) refund target must never be a
permanent loss or book-brick. All three deliver to the bid's RECORDED destination, which `place_bid`
sets to the bidder's CANONICAL ATAs (`bidder_coin_ata(bidder, coin_mint)` / `(bidder, collateral_mint)`,
lines 1242/1244 — findings V/AB), so any closed target is permissionlessly recreatable:
 - `claim` (settled bid): pins `usd_dest == dest_key && coin_ata == coin_key` (line 1602). Closed-target
   recovery TESTED by finding V (`e2e_closing_refund_ata_...`, COIN) + AB (`e2e_closing_usd_dest_...`, USD).
 - place_bid EVICTION (full book, strictly-better bid refunds the evicted bidder): pins
   `evict_acct == evicted_ata` (line 1197). Closed-target recovery TESTED by AM
   (`e2e_closed_weakest_ata_cannot_permanently_block_eviction`).
 - `cancel_bid` (unsettled bid, bidder-signed, cooldown-gated): pins `coin_ata == coin_key` (line 1698).
   This is the LOWEST-severity path and the only untested one — a closed target here does NOT brick the
   book (an un-cancelled bid simply settles normally at the next execute) and is self-inflicted (the
   bidder closed their own ATA), recoverable by recreating it. No test added (marginal vs V/AM: same
   canonical-ATA invariant, no book-brick, no external attacker).
Verdict: the no-permanent-brick-via-closed-refund-target guarantee holds on every refund path.

### [STATE] Permissionless-fund-mover redirect class — fully analyzed across all six binaries
Completing AV/AW/AX: enumerated every PERMISSIONLESS instruction that touches funds, across all six
binaries, to confirm none lets the caller redirect value to themselves. All BLOCKED:
 - twap `execute` (crank): the 3 movable-balance destinations are pinned + tested — holding (the surplus
   pull; cranker-cannot-redirect-surplus), coin_sink (SEND buyback; AV), settlement_usd (spent USD; AX).
 - twap `claim` (crank): usd_dest pinned (winner test) + coin_ata pinned (loser refund; AW) — both ==
   the bid's recorded CANONICAL ATAs (V/AB).
 - twap `cancel_bid`: bidder-BOUND (`SL_BIDDER == bidder.key`, only the bidder cancels their own bid) +
   refund to the recorded canonical coin_ata; no cranker, no redirect.
 - distribution `burn_unclaimed` (crank): pins `vault == config.vault && coin_mint == config.coin_mint`
   and BURNS (no transfer destination) — only the config's own remainder, after the window.
 - distribution `claim`: recipient-SIGNED (`pk == recipient`), recipient directs their own payout.
 - genesis-vote `trigger` (crank): pins distribution program/config/proposal and only SEALS — moves no
   funds to the cranker.
 - subledger `deposit`/`withdraw`: owner-SIGNED; the owner directs their own funds (and the holding
   intermediate is SPL-authority-bound, finding AU).
No new code/test: the twap crank paths are the only ones with a redirectable destination, and they are
now all pinned + tested; the rest move no funds to the caller or are owner/recipient/bidder-signed.

### [BLOCKED] AX. Permissionless cranker redirects execute's spent USD via a substituted settlement_usd (external LOF)
Completes the AV/AW sweep of permissionless-cranker payout redirects. `execute` parks the budget it
spends this round (`total_usd`, moved from the holding) into `settlement_usd`, from which winners later
claim their `usd_owed`. If `settlement_usd` weren't pinned, a cranker would pass THEIR OWN collateral
account and (a) steal the spent USD and (b) brick winners' claims, since claim reads `book.settlement_usd`
which would be left empty. BLOCKED: execute pins `settlement_usd == book.settlement_usd` in its main
account-validation block, so a substituted account is rejected before any transfer and the whole execute
reverts. Pinned by `e2e_execute_cranker_cannot_redirect_the_spent_usd`. With AV (coin_sink, the SEND
buyback sink) and the pre-existing cranker-cannot-redirect-surplus (the holding, the pull destination),
all THREE movable-balance destinations a cranker controls in execute are now pinned + tested; the
remaining main-block accounts (coin_escrow/coin_mint/market_slab/book_escrow/twap_authority) are
accounting/auth pins, not direct-theft destinations.

### [BLOCKED] AW. Permissionless cranker redirects a loser's COIN refund via a substituted coin_ata (external LOF)
Sibling of AV on the claim path. `claim` is PERMISSIONLESS and pays a settled bid's `coin_refund`
(coin_escrow -> coin_ata); for a LOSER (eligible but unfilled because the budget ran out) the refund is
the FULL escrowed COIN. If `coin_ata` weren't pinned, a cranker would claim the loser's slot with THEIR
OWN COIN account and steal the refund. BLOCKED: claim requires `coin_ata == the bid's recorded canonical
COIN ATA` (and `usd_dest == the recorded canonical collateral ATA`) — findings V/AB — so a substituted
account is rejected and the refund stays claimable to the bidder. The pre-existing
`e2e_claim_cannot_redirect_a_winners_payout` only covered the USD side AND its winner sold all its COIN
(coin_refund == 0), so the COIN-refund redirect with a NON-ZERO refund was untested. Pinned by
`e2e_claim_cannot_redirect_a_losers_coin_refund`: alice wins and takes the 400k budget, bob loses
(rate 0.25, unfilled) and is owed a full 100k COIN refund; a cranker claiming bob's slot with their own
coin account is rejected (0 redirected), then the honest claim delivers bob's 100k to his canonical ATA.

### [BLOCKED] AV. Permissionless cranker redirects the SEND buyback via a substituted coin_sink (external LOF)
`execute` is PERMISSIONLESS (any cranker turns it). In SEND (buyback) mode it transfers the bought COIN
to a `coin_sink` passed as a TRAILING account. If the sink were not pinned, a hostile cranker would
pass THEIR OWN COIN account and steal the entire buyback — a direct external LOF (the bought COIN is
the protocol's/treasury's). BLOCKED: execute checks `*coin_sink.key == book.coin_sink` (the DAO-set,
Squads-gated sink recorded on the book) before the transfer, so a substituted sink is rejected and the
whole execute reverts (book unsettled, COIN safe in escrow). Pinned by
`e2e_execute_send_cranker_cannot_redirect_the_buyback`: a cranker passes their own COIN account as the
sink -> rejected, 0 redirected; the honest execute (book-recorded treasury sink) then routes the 400k
bought COIN to the treasury. Distinct from AS (set-time self-loop guard) and AH (happy-path
burn->send flip) — this is the execute-time redirect by an external cranker, which was untested.

### [BLOCKED] AU. insurance_deposit holding-intermediate substitution/duplicate — SPL authority is the boundary
`insurance_deposit` routes funds user_ata -> `holding` (user-signed) -> percolator insurance vault
(`TopUpInsurance`, signed by the pool PDA). The subledger does NOT explicitly check `holding.owner ==
pool`; it relies on SPL authority at the CPI. Probed every substitution/duplicate of `holding`:
 - Foreign (non-pool-owned) holding: step 1 lands the user's funds there, but step 2's
   `TopUpInsurance` is the pool moving funds OUT of the holding — only the holding's authority can
   authorize that, and the pool's signature only covers pool-owned accounts, so the SPL transfer
   fails and the whole instruction REVERTS (step 1 rolled back, user funds safe). The position is
   credited only AFTER both transfers (lines 941-953), so a failed deposit never credits.
 - Attacker-created pool-owned holding, optionally pre-funded: harmless — the user's `amount` still
   flows to the vault and the position is credited exactly `amount` (the `amount`-consistency: step1,
   step2, and the credit are all the same `amount`); any pre-funding is stranded in the holding
   (attacker self-loss), never an over-credit or inflation.
 - holding == owner_ata (duplicate): contradictory — step 1 needs owner-signable, step 2 needs
   pool-owned; no account is both, so it always fails.
 - holding == percolator_vault: step 1 funds the vault directly and step 2's vault->vault no-op still
   increments the insurance counter by the same `amount` — consistent (counter and balance both +amount;
   and a direct TopUpInsurance to inflate the counter without funding is impossible since only the
   subledger can sign as the pool operator).
No code change / no test: the boundary is the SPL token program's authority check (a runtime
invariant), so any negative test would be tautological. Recorded so future ticks don't re-derive it.

### [STATE] Audit sweep — input-validation, retract/re-back, clearing math, remaining-account smuggling
Iteration with no fresh reachable gap; re-confirmed (so future ticks skip them):
 - `set_reserve` input validation matches `init_book`: it rejects `reserve_den == 0` (twap
   src ~977), so the degenerate "infinite reserve filters every bid -> permanent auction DOS" can't be
   set even via Squads. (cmp_rate cross-multiplies, so no div-by-zero regardless.)
 - retract/re-back tally integrity: retract subtracts the BALLOT's recorded `voted_weight`/principal;
   re-back recomputes a FRESH weight from the current position. A top-up between (which resets
   start_slot, finding AT) just yields a fresh, correct weight — the tally always equals the sum of
   live ballots, no inflation.
 - clearing-math solvency: every filled bid prices at the marginal P* = cm/um and `coin_i =
   floor(usd_i*cm/um) <= C_i` because its rate >= P*; a bid AT P* fully filled sells exactly C_i
   (refund 0). So `total_coin <= escrow` and per-bid refunds sum to the post-burn escrow — no
   over-draw (pinned by the partial-marginal + happy-path tests).
 - remaining-account smuggling: handlers read fixed accounts via sequential next_account_info and
   IGNORE extras; the only conditional trailing reads (execute SEND coin_sink, place_bid eviction
   target, init_book SEND coin_sink) are each pinned (== book.coin_sink / == evicted bid's canonical
   ATA / != coin_escrow) so a smuggled account is rejected, not honored.
 - re-deposit after a full exit is blocked: full withdraw sets `withdrawn=true` and the deposit's
   existing-position branch rejects `p.withdrawn` (findings AR/AR-2), and the position PDA is unique
   per (pool, owner) so no fresh position can be opened either.

### [BLOCKED] AT. Early-squat-then-top-up to inflate vote hold-time (Sybil) — every deposit resets start_slot
Vote weight is `floor(log2(now - start_slot)) * principal`. Probe: a whale deposits 1 atom at genesis
start, lets the age compound for a long time, then tops up a HUGE principal right before voting — if
the top-up did NOT reset `start_slot`, ALL of that late capital would earn the early-join age =
inflated weight (gaming the hold-time multiplier with capital that was only just put at risk). BLOCKED:
`process_insurance_deposit` sets `position.start_slot = Clock::get()?.slot` on EVERY deposit (new or
top-up), so a late top-up's hold-time clock restarts at the top-up slot. (And the retire-then-redeposit
variant is also closed: a full withdraw sets `withdrawn=true`, and the deposit's existing-position
branch rejects `p.withdrawn` — finding AR / AR-2.) Pinned by `top_up_resets_the_position_start_slot`:
deposit 1 atom at slot 100, warp, top up ~2M at slot 1000 -> the position's start_slot reads back 1000
(reset), not 100, so the late capital earns no early-join age. (Aside, observed not a meta vuln: the
real percolator rejects an insurance deposit after a very large slot gap, Custom 0x1b — irrelevant to
the bounded genesis deposit window.) Distinct from the existing single-deposit start_slot check.

### [FIXED] AS. SEND (buyback) sink could be set to the coin_escrow — self-loop strands the buyback
Duplicate-account self-loop. `set_coin_sink` and `init_book` validated only `coin_sink.mint ==
coin_mint`, but the shared COIN escrow (`coin_escrow`) is ALSO a coin-mint account. If a SEND-mode sink
were set to it, `execute`'s SEND step does `spl_transfer(coin_escrow -> coin_sink, total_coin)` =
escrow -> escrow, a no-op: the bought COIN stays in the escrow and is STRANDED forever (a fixed-supply
COIN, and the escrow only ever pays bidders' recorded `coin_refund`), so the DAO's buyback is silently
nullified and the COIN is locked. Not an external-attacker LOF (the sink is Squads-vault-gated +
timelock'd), but a real correctness loss reachable via a buggy proposal-generation tool or a confused
DAO. FIX: both `set_coin_sink` and `init_book` now reject `coin_sink == coin_escrow` in SEND mode (the
other internal token accounts — settlement_usd, holding — are already excluded by the
`mint == coin_mint` check, being collateral-mint). Pinned by `e2e_send_sink_cannot_be_the_coin_escrow`:
flipping to SEND with the sink == coin_escrow is rejected via Squads, while a genuine external treasury
sink is accepted. 57 chain tests green.

### [STATE] Tick constrained by a broken read-only sibling — six-binary e2e unbuildable
The `percolator-prog` sibling (read-only to this repo) is mid-edit and currently fails to compile
(`error[E0308]` in `src/v16_program.rs`, uncommitted). The two e2e harnesses that link percolator's
LIB — `twap-program/tests/chain.rs` (the six-binary suite) and `subledger/tests/insurance_percolator.rs`
— therefore cannot build, so no new percolator-touching attack can be build-verified this tick (and the
deferred AR-2 own-vault-withdraw test waits on it). The STANDALONE real-binary harnesses do NOT link
percolator and were re-run GREEN this tick: `subledger/tests/subledger.rs` (own-vault, 5),
`genesis-vote/tests/seal.rs` (gv + distribution + Squads, 5), `distribution/tests/distribution.rs` (8).
A focused re-probe of those surfaces (gv vote/weight/quorum + live-outstanding trigger; distribution
claim/seal one-shot/burn-window; own-vault deposit/withdraw/pro-rata) found no fresh, non-redundant
vector — they remain exhaustively covered. All four percolator-meta PROGRAMS still `build-sbf` clean
(they don't link the sibling lib). Resume full six-binary probing + the AR-2 test once percolator-prog
compiles again.

### [BLOCKED] AR-2. Phantom-capital vote via the OWN-VAULT withdraw path (finding AR follow-up)
Follow-up to AR: the subledger has a SECOND exit, the own-vault withdraw (`process_withdraw`, IX 2),
which sets `withdrawn=true` and pays out WITHOUT decrementing `position.principal`. If it could run on
the genesis INSURANCE pool, a voter could "exit" via it, leave `principal` intact, and re-vote with
phantom capital (the AR attack, on a path where principal is NOT zeroed). BLOCKED three independent
ways: (a) `process_withdraw` rejects insurance pools up front — `if pool.is_insurance() { return Err }`
(subledger/src/lib.rs:~586, the withdraw twin of the existing
`own_vault_deposit_is_rejected_on_an_insurance_pool` guard); (b) an insurance pool's vault is the
percolator insurance vault, owned by the market `vault_authority`, NOT the pool PDA, so the pool can't
sign its `spl_transfer`; (c) the position is mutated only AFTER the payout transfer, so any failure
reverts the whole instruction (no partial `withdrawn=true`). So the only exit reachable for the genesis
pool remains `process_insurance_withdraw` (IX 5), which decrements `principal` (finding AR). No new test
this tick: the subledger integration tests link the percolator-prog LIB, and that sibling is currently
mid-edit / fails to compile (uncommitted changes, read-only to this repo), so a new e2e test cannot be
build-verified right now. Pinned by `own_vault_withdraw_is_rejected_on_an_insurance_pool`: IX 2 on the genesis insurance position
is rejected and the position is left fully intact (principal unchanged, not retired).

### [BLOCKED] AR. Phantom-capital vote with a withdrawn position (Sybil bypass) — withdraw decrements live principal
Probe: vote weight must reflect capital genuinely at risk. genesis-vote `read_sub_position` reads the
position's `principal` (and start_slot) but does NOT inspect a "withdrawn" flag — so IF a withdrawal
left `principal` intact, a voter could deposit P, back a proposal, retract, WITHDRAW P (capital
returned, pool.outstanding -= P), then back AGAIN and vote with the stale P. Because the quorum
denominator (`read_sub_pool_outstanding`, read live by `trigger`) had dropped, the phantom vote would
be FREE and would shrink the denominator — letting a tiny attacker cycle deposit->vote->withdraw to
capture the genesis with capital they no longer hold. BLOCKED: the live insurance-withdraw
(`process_insurance_withdraw`, IX 5) DECREMENTS `position.principal -= amount` (not just a flag), so a
full exit zeroes the live principal and the re-vote computes `vote_weight(0, age) == 0` -> rejected
("position has no vote weight"); a partial exit leaves only the remaining at-risk principal as weight.
Confirmed end-to-end against the real subledger+genesis-vote binaries by
`cannot_vote_with_a_withdrawn_position`: deposit -> vote -> retract -> full withdraw (principal read
back as 0) -> re-vote REJECTED. (Distinct from `vote_locked_principal_cannot_exit_until_retracted`,
which only pins that you cannot exit WHILE a vote is live; this pins that after a legitimate exit the
returned capital carries no vote weight.) NOTE: my initial read confused two withdraw functions — the
580-650 path only flips `withdrawn`, but it is NOT the live insurance-withdraw the genesis uses (IX 5
-> the principal-decrementing handler).

### [FIXED] AQ. Parasite config on the same market drains the victim's insurance (CRITICAL LOF) — twap_authority was market-scoped, not config-scoped
REAL CRITICAL bug, the deepest layer of finding AD. The `twap_authority` (the percolator insurance
OPERATOR granted by the handoff) was derived from `["market-0-twap", market, percolator_program]` —
NOT bound to the config's squads/coin. So TWO twap configs on the SAME (market, percolator_program),
differing only in squads_multisig/coin_mint, derived the SAME operator PDA. And `execute` computes the
pull as `insurance - config.reserved_floor` using the CALLING config's OWN floor. Attack: (1) the
attacker stands up a PARASITE config-A on the VICTIM's market (`init_config` does not validate the
market's admin, so any squads/coin works); (2) config-A's twap_authority == the victim's operator PDA;
(3) config-A sets ITS OWN `reserved_floor` to 0 via its own Squads; (4) anyone cranks `execute(config-A)`
— percolator only checks the signer is the (shared) operator, so it pays out `insurance * bps` into
config-A's holding. CONFIRMED end-to-end: the parasite drained the victim's insurance 1,500,000 ->
300,000 (BELOW the 1M depositor-principal floor — principal stolen), 1,200,000 landing in the
parasite's holding, which config-A then sweeps via shutdown.
FIX: bind the `twap_authority` seed to the CONFIG PDA — `["market-0-twap", config]` (the config PDA
already commits to market+squads+coin+perc via finding P). Now the operator is UNIQUE per config: only
the single config the handoff actually granted to derives the real operator; a parasite derives a
DISTINCT PDA that percolator does not recognize as the operator, so its `execute` (and any further CPI)
is rejected. Updated `authority_seeds`, `init_config`'s bump derivation, and all four signer sites
(accept_operator, execute, shutdown, init_book's holding-owner check) + every chain.rs derivation. The
legit handoff/execute/buy-burn E2E still passes (grant + execute derive the new seed consistently).
Pinned by `e2e_parasite_config_on_same_market_cannot_drain_insurance` (the confirming drain test,
flipped to assert BLOCKED: parasite authority != operator, execute rejected, victim insurance fully
intact, parasite pulls nothing) and `e2e_twap_authority_seed_binds_to_config_no_operator_reuse`
(anchored to the real grant: operator == config-bound seed, != the old (market,perc) seed, != any
other config's derivation). NOTE: the subledger pool operator is already pool-unique (its seed includes
mint+asset_id+market+perc, finding Q), so it has no analogous parasite.

### [BLOCKED/INVARIANT] AP. init_book escrow `amount == 0` is a latent finding-AI pre-fund surface — safe ONLY via random escrow addresses
`process_init_book` requires the shared COIN escrow and the settlement-USD account to be EMPTY at
init (`ce.amount != 0 -> reject`, `su.amount != 0 -> reject`) for a clean accounting start. Probe: a
transfer to a token account needs no destination signature (cf. finding AI's lamport pre-fund), so if
those escrow addresses were DETERMINISTIC (e.g. canonical ATAs of the `book_escrow` PDA), an attacker
could dust one with 1 token BEFORE the DAO's timelock'd init_book — making `amount != 0` reject it
forever (the balance can't be swept until the book_escrow PDA can sign, which only exists post-init):
a permanent book-init DOS. CURRENTLY BLOCKED: the escrows (and the holding) are RANDOM, DAO-chosen
token-account addresses (`Pubkey::new_unique()` in setup, never a PDA/ATA), so an attacker cannot
predict or pre-fund them. The `holding` has no amount check at all (a pre-funded holding is just extra
starting budget — harmless), so only the two escrows carry the empty-requirement. INVARIANT to
preserve: the escrow/settlement token accounts MUST stay at unpredictable addresses, OR — if a future
refactor makes them deterministic (ATAs) — `init_book` must tolerate a pre-funded balance the same way
`create_pda_robust` tolerates pre-funded lamports (finding AI), rather than reject on `amount != 0`.
No test: the attack is unreachable at random addresses, and asserting "init_book rejects a non-empty
escrow" only pins a DAO-side sanity check (not an attacker path).

### [BLOCKED] AO. Cross-config book mutation — `book.config` pin is LOAD-BEARING (not the squads gate)
Probe: the twap program is generic/reusable, so multiple (config, book) pairs for DIFFERENT
markets/DAOs can coexist. A malicious DAO that controls config-A's Squads tries to grief config-B's
auction by calling a Squads-gated book mutator (`set_reserve` / `set_bid_fee` / `set_coin_sink`) with
config-A (their squads SIGNS) + config-B's BOOK — setting a hostile reserve/fee or retargeting the
COIN sink on the victim's auction. Key insight: `require_squads_vault(config)` does NOT stop this — it
passes for the attacker's OWN config-A. The only thing that blocks it is the explicit
`book.config == config_account.key` check, which every book mutator performs right after loading the
header (`set_reserve` twap-program/src/lib.rs:~966, `set_bid_fee` ~1027, `set_coin_sink` ~1000); a
mismatched book is rejected. `shutdown` + `set_reserved_floor` take no book and are config-scoped (the
holding is owned by the config's twap_authority; `set_reserved_floor` writes only `config`). VERDICT:
BLOCKED — the `book.config` pin is load-bearing and uniformly present, so cross-config griefing is
impossible. NOW PINNED end-to-end by `e2e_config_a_cannot_mutate_config_bs_book_reserve`: it stands up
a SECOND independent twap config (config-A: its own Squads multisig + market + coin + init_config under
an attacker DAO), then has config-A's Squads vault authorize a hostile `set_reserve` (rate 999/1,
which would block every real bid) against config-B's BOOK. The inner set_reserve is rejected on
`book.config != config_account` (require_squads_vault PASSES for config-A's own vault — proving the
pin, not the squads gate, is the boundary), config-B's reserve is untouched, and the positive control
(config-B setting its OWN book reserve) still works. The `book.config` checks must never be removed as
"redundant" — they are the sole cross-config boundary.

### [COVERAGE] AN. cancel_bid CLEARED-path release (anti-permanent-lock liveness) — distinct branch pinned
The cancel_bid cooldown opens on `cleared` (an execute moved `round_end` since placement) OR `aged`
(2*round_length elapsed). The aged branch is covered (`e2e_bid_cancellable_after_cooldown_keeps_fee`);
the `cleared` branch — the PRIMARY "one round of twap clears the book" release — was untested. It is a
liveness/DOS boundary: a regression breaking `cleared` would lock a committed bidder's COIN after a
roll (an execute that buys nothing) until 2*round_length, yet still pass the aged-path test. Also a
spoof-relevant edge (the anti-spoof design relies on cancel being gated until the bid has been exposed
to at least one round). Pinned by `e2e_roll_opens_the_cleared_cancel_path`, which isolates the branch
rigorously: at the SAME slot E1 (= round_end) cancel is REJECTED before the roll (cleared=false +
aged=false) and ALLOWED immediately after the roll-execute (cleared=true, aged STILL false, since
2*round_length has not elapsed) — so the only thing that opened cancel is the roll advancing
round_end, and the bidder reclaims their full escrowed COIN. (A bid present at a REAL settlement is
marked SETTLED and uncancellable, so this release never lets a spoofer escape a purchase — see AE +
e2e_cancel_cannot_double_spend_a_settled_bid.)

### [BLOCKED] AM. Closed-ATA poison bid on the EVICTION path — uncensorability stays recoverable
Finding V pinned the canonical-ATA recoverability on the CLAIM path
(`e2e_closing_refund_ata_cannot_permanently_brick_the_book`), but the place_bid EVICTION path is a
distinct code path that was untested for a closed refund ATA. Probe: in a FULL 32-slot book the
weakest bidder closes their canonical coin ATA; a strictly-better bid must evict the weakest and
refund it there. The eviction's `spl_transfer` to the closed ATA fails, so the better bid is
temporarily blocked — a griefing attempt against the core uncensorable-bid guarantee. BLOCKED /
self-healing: the refund target is the weakest bid's CANONICAL ATA (finding V), which anyone can
recreate permissionlessly; after recreation the eviction succeeds and refunds. Not a permanent brick,
and the poison bid is exposed to consumption/clearing at the next execute regardless. Pinned by
`e2e_closed_weakest_ata_cannot_permanently_block_eviction`: eviction blocked while the ATA is closed
(better bid's COIN un-escrowed, funds intact), then succeeds + refunds once the ATA is recreated. A
regression pointing the eviction refund away from the canonical ATA would be caught here but NOT by
finding V's claim-path test.

### [STATE] Audit sweep — handoff gating, claim/burn window edge, execute arithmetic all confirmed covered
Iteration with no new vector (all probed surfaces BLOCKED + already pinned); recorded so future ticks
skip them:
 - `accept_operator` (the percolator insurance-operator handoff) is Squads-vault-gated
   (`squads_vault.is_signer` + `== squads_default_vault(config.squads_multisig)`), pins
   market/program/authority to the config, grants to the finding-AD-bound twap_authority, and rotates
   the deposit authority to the vault (finding S). A non-vault signer is rejected — already pinned by
   the negative case in `e2e_dao_reconfigures_twap_only_after_timelock` (imposter `IX_ACCEPT_OPERATOR`
   rejected) and the positive handoff e2e.
 - distribution claim/burn window boundary is race-free and FULLY pinned at the exact slot by
   `unclaimed_is_burned_after_window`: at `slot == window_end`, `claim` is rejected (`>=`) AND
   `burn_unclaimed` is allowed (`< window_end` false) — claims close exactly as burns open, so a
   boundary-slot claim can never be front-run by the burn (no LOF), and only UNCLAIMED amounts burn.
 - `execute` surplus/burnable/ratchet math is fully checked (`saturating_sub` + `checked_mul`/`_sub`/
   `_add`); the ratchet invariant `reserved_floor <= insurance` holds even when percolator caps the
   actual pull below `burnable` (the unpulled remainder rolls to next round; no principal loss).
 - finding S (post-handoff deposits drainable as surplus) is pinned end-to-end by
   `e2e_post_handoff_deposit_blocked_by_authority_revoke` + `e2e_subledger_exit_blocked_after_operator_handoff`.

### [BLOCKED] AL. Substituted percolator_vault token account at execute — relies on the percolator boundary
`execute` pins the vault_AUTHORITY (`vault_authority == perc_vault_authority(market_slab,
percolator_program)`, covered by `e2e_execute_rejects_foreign_market_vault_authority`) but hands the
`percolator_vault` TOKEN account straight into `WithdrawInsuranceLimited` WITHOUT pinning it to the
canonical address — it trusts the percolator CPI to validate the vault. Probe: a permissionless
cranker substitutes a DIFFERENT token account owned by the REAL vault_authority (a bait the attacker
funds) as `percolator_vault`, trying to redirect the pull (drain a wrong account / desync percolator's
insurance accounting against the real vault). BLOCKED: the real percolator binary validates the vault
is the market's canonical insurance vault and rejects the substitution; `execute` fails and BOTH the
real insurance vault and the bait are untouched, while the honest (canonical-vault) execute still
pulls the burn-share. Pinned by `e2e_execute_rejects_substituted_percolator_vault` — a distinct
account from the vault-authority test (the token account vs its authority); arithmetic in the
surplus/burnable/ratchet path is also fully checked (checked_mul/sub/add + saturating_sub, and
reserved_floor <= insurance holds). Verdict: the twap correctly leans on percolator's own vault check;
no twap-side pin needed.

### [BLOCKED] AK. Deposit with a foreign market routes capital away while crediting vote weight (Sybil)
The Sybil-resistance invariant is that vote weight must be backed by capital genuinely at risk in the
GENESIS market. `insurance_deposit` credits `position.principal` (which becomes vote weight) and CPIs
`TopUpInsurance` to move the capital. Probe: pass a FOREIGN `market_slab` (a market the attacker
controls / can reclaim from) while depositing to the genesis pool — getting a credited position
without leaving capital truly at risk = free governance power, defeating the whole bootstrap.
BLOCKED: deposit pins `market_slab == pool.market_slab`, `percolator_vault == pool.vault`,
`percolator_program == pool.percolator_program` (and re-derives the pool PDA, finding Q), so the
TopUp can only ever go to the pool's bound market; a foreign slab is rejected before any position is
created. (Voting is doubly bound: `genesis-vote::vote` also pins `sub_pool == config.subledger_pool`,
so even a fully-legit position in a DIFFERENT pool carries no genesis weight.) Pinned by
`deposit_with_foreign_market_slab_credits_no_position`: a foreign-slab deposit is rejected, no
position is created, outstanding stays 0, the attacker's capital is untouched. Distinct code path from
the withdraw foreign-slab pin (finding AF) — a regression dropping the deposit pin would not be caught
by AF. Previously untested.

### [BLOCKED] AJ. Re-init of a live account (regression guard for finding AI) — state-reset LOF
The finding-AI fix relaxed every init guard from `lamports() != 0 || data_len() != 0` to
`data_len() != 0` (so a dusted-but-empty PDA can still be created). Probe: does that weaken re-init
protection? If a SECOND init on an already-initialized PDA succeeded, an attacker could re-init a LIVE
subledger pool and reset `outstanding_principal` (the genesis quorum denominator) to 0 — instantly
collapsing the quorum threshold so a tiny minority captures the distribution — or re-point the pool's
vault/policy. BLOCKED: an initialized account always carries data, so `data_len() != 0` still rejects
the re-init (the relaxation only ignores lamports, which never indicate initialization). Confirmed by
`insurance_pool_cannot_be_reinitialized_after_funding`: a funded pool (1M outstanding) is re-init'd on
the same PDA → rejected, outstanding untouched. This re-init boundary was previously UNTESTED anywhere
in the stack; the test doubles as the regression guard for the finding-AI guard change.

### [FIXED] AI. Lamport pre-fund permanently bricks every init (whole stack) — cheap griefing DOS
REAL bug (HIGH), found via the PDA-creation discussion. Every init handler creates its PDA with the
System `create_account`, which aborts with `AccountAlreadyInUse` (Custom(0)) on ANY pre-existing
lamports — AND the handlers additionally guard `if lamports() != 0 -> AlreadyInitialized`. A PDA
address is deterministic and public; a plain `transfer` to it needs NO signature. So an attacker
sends 1 lamport to the address BEFORE the legit init and that init can NEVER succeed: the guard (and
then create_account) reject it forever, and the lamports can't be swept (no one can sign for a
system-owned PDA). Confirmed end-to-end against the real subledger binary
(`lamport_prefund_cannot_brick_insurance_pool_init`): dusting the pool PDA made init fail first with
the handler's own `AccountAlreadyInitialized`, and after relaxing that guard, with the System
program's "account ... already in use" — BOTH causes proven empirically. Impact is critical on the
genesis path: dusting the deterministic subledger POOL PDA bricks the whole bootstrap, and dusting a
depositor's deterministic POSITION PDA bricks that specific user's first deposit (targeted LOF/DOS).
FIX: `create_pda_robust` — reject re-init by `data_len() != 0` (NOT lamports), then top up the rent
shortfall with a plain `transfer` and `allocate` + `assign` via invoke_signed; allocate/assign only
require the account to be data-empty + system-owned, both true for a merely pre-funded address, so the
dust is absorbed instead of fatal. Applied STACK-WIDE to every PDA-creating init handler: subledger (insurance +
own-vault pool inits, both position inits), twap (config + book), genesis-vote (config + proposal +
ballot, via its shared `create_pda` helper made robust), distribution (config + proposal). Each gates
re-init on `data_len() != 0` and creates via the robust top-up + allocate + assign. The confirming
test `lamport_prefund_cannot_brick_insurance_pool_init` passes (init succeeds despite the dust); all
existing init tests across the four programs stay green (the robust create is behavior-compatible on a
zero-lamport account). Also fixed a pre-existing stale `dist_config` derivation in
genesis-vote/tests/seal.rs (finding-AA follow-up: the seal authority must be folded into the seed).
The twap BOOK path (distinct: Squads-gated, squads_vault as the robust-create payer) is pinned
end-to-end by `e2e_lamport_prefund_cannot_brick_book_init`: dusting the deterministic book PDA before
the timelock'd init_book no longer bricks it — the book is created and the auction clears + burns
normally (proving no corrupted half-init).

### [VERIFIED] AH. Buyback-vs-burn is DAO-controllable ONLY via Squads (twap) — not via permissionless init
Design confirmation prompted by the futarchy->Squads->twap authority arm: the buy/burn SINK MODE
(burn vs buyback-to-treasury) and its destination must be settable AND changeable by the futarchy
acting through Squads, but must NEVER ride on the permissionless `init_config` (a front-runner could
squat the config PDA and route bought COIN to an attacker account — the not-in-seed-field squat from
finding P). Verified the code already enforces exactly this: `init_book` and `set_coin_sink` both call
`require_squads_vault` (the Squads default vault must sign, behind the 1-week timelock), and
`set_coin_sink` flips `sink_mode` burn<->send (data[0]) + validates the SEND destination's mint (or
clears it on BURN). So the SEND destination is only ever DAO-set; a squatted `init_config` carries no
sink at all. The init-time SEND routing was pinned (`e2e_send_mode_routes_bought_coin_to_treasury_not_attacker`);
the CHANGE path was not. Added `e2e_dao_flips_burn_to_buyback_only_via_squads`: an auction starts in
BURN mode, a forged non-Squads `set_coin_sink` is rejected, the DAO flips BURN->SEND via a timelock'd
Squads execute, and the next `execute` routes the 400k bought COIN to the treasury (supply unchanged —
buyback does NOT burn). Pins that monetary policy is DAO-tunable through Squads and only through Squads.

### [BLOCKED] AG. Winner re-seal / winner-take-all override (distribution + genesis-vote)
Probe: two genesis proposals compete; A reaches a weighted majority and is sealed (COIN becomes
claimable to A's recipients). Later, vote shifts (retract from A, back B) push B over the majority.
Can B's permissionless `trigger` re-seal the distribution to B — changing the winner after A's COIN
is already claimable (double-distribution / theft of the COIN supply)? BLOCKED at two independent
points: (1) `distribution::seal_winner` is ONE-SHOT — `if config.is_sealed() return Err` (it records
`sealed_proposal` + `seal_slot` on first seal and refuses any later seal), and `claim` only pays
`config.sealed_proposal`; (2) `genesis-vote::trigger` sets `pv.executed = true` and refuses to act on
an already-executed proposal, and its seal CPI is signed by the gv config as the distribution's bound
authority. So the FIRST proposal to reach quorum+majority wins immutably; a later majority swing
cannot override it (B's trigger fails at the seal CPI). Note this is a deliberate
first-past-the-post: quorum + strict-majority can be met by at most one proposal at a time (they share
`total_cast_weight`), and the winner is locked the instant it seals. No new test — the one-shot guard
is explicit and the property is an extension of the existing winner-take-all/no-new-proposal coverage
(`only_the_winning_proposals_recipients_can_claim`, `no new proposal after finalize`).

### [BLOCKED] AF. Cross-market haircut-basis substitution (subledger) — pro-rata exit reads a pinned slab
Probe: a depositor in an IMPAIRED genesis pool tries to inflate their pro-rata exit by passing a
DIFFERENT, HEALTHY market's slab as `market_slab`. `withdraw`'s pro-rata haircut reads the live
insurance BASIS straight from `market_slab` (findings L + T, offset 749); if that read could be
pointed at an un-impaired market, `payout()` would see `insurance >= outstanding`, treat the exit as
healthy, and pay FULL principal while the actual `WithdrawInsuranceLimited` pull still drains the
real (impaired) market — stealing the loss-share owed to the depositors who stay. BLOCKED:
`process_*_withdraw` pins `market_slab.key == pool.market_slab` (and `percolator_vault == pool.vault`,
`percolator_program == pool.percolator_program`, `vault_authority == perc_vault_authority(market_slab,
perc)`) BEFORE reading insurance or signing the pull, so the haircut basis and the pull source are the
SAME pinned market. The defense existed but had no negative test on the subledger side (the twap had
the symmetric `e2e_execute_rejects_foreign_market_vault_authority`). Pinned by
`foreign_market_slab_cannot_inflate_the_haircut`: alice (1M) in a market impaired to 50% points
`market_slab` at a cloned HEALTHY slab (2M insurance) — rejected, position untouched, 0 extracted —
then her honest exit on the real slab pays exactly the 500k haircut, proving the foreign basis bought
no advantage.

Broad audit this tick (all BLOCKED, no new bug): distribution `claim` double-spend (guarded by
`amount==0 -> already claimed` + zero-after-transfer + pull-model recipient-only + claim-window) and
`burn_unclaimed` early-burn grief (window-gated, `clock < window_end` rejected); genesis-vote `vote`
fabricated-weight via a fake position (guarded by `sub_position.owner == config.subledger_program` +
canonical-PDA-for-(pool,voter) + disc, so neither an attacker-owned forgery nor someone else's real
position works); twap Config/AuctionBook type-cosplay (distinct discriminators TWAPCFG1/TWAPBOK1
checked at deserialize) and `place_bid` mint-confusion (coin_mint/collateral_mint/coin_escrow all
pinned to the book, src/dest mints re-checked). Discriminator hygiene is uniform across all four
programs (SUBPOOL1/SUBPOS01, GVCONFG1/GVBALOT1/GVPROPV1, DISTCFG1/DISTPRP1, TWAPCFG1/TWAPBOK1).

### [HARDENED] AE. Roll-undo left SL_COIN_REFUND stale (twap-program) — latent, non-exploitable state-restore gap
`execute` clears the book against the pulled budget. When NOTHING is bought (`total_coin == 0` — a
"roll": surplus below the floor so budget 0, OR a budget so small every marginal fill rounds to zero
COIN atoms) the round is NOT settled: bids stay committed and `round_end` advances. The roll-undo
loop restored each occupied slot's `SL_USD_OWED` and `SL_SETTLED` — but NOT `SL_COIN_REFUND`, which
the settlement loop may already have written (= full escrow) on every slot when a marginal bid was
selected yet all `coin_i` rounded to 0. So a rolled bid could carry a stale `SL_COIN_REFUND` into the
next round. ANALYSIS: not exploitable today — `SL_COIN_REFUND` is read only by `claim`, which requires
`SETTLED == 1` (reset to 0 by the roll); `cancel`/`evict` read `SL_COIN`, not `SL_COIN_REFUND`; and
the next REAL settlement overwrites `SL_COIN_REFUND` for every occupied slot before it is ever read.
But relying on "overwritten-before-read" is fragile and violates the invariant that a roll fully
restores each bid to its pre-execute bytes. HARDENED: the roll-undo now also zeroes `SL_COIN_REFUND`,
so a rolled bid is byte-identical to its pre-execute self for the subsequent cancel/evict/settle
paths. Pinned by `e2e_roll_with_committed_bid_settles_correctly_next_round`: a 400k/400k bid rides
through a budget-0 roll (insurance dropped below the floor — assert nothing pulled, no COIN burned,
the unsettled bid is NOT claimable) and then settles byte-exactly next round once surplus is restored
(full 400k COIN burned, 0 refund, full USD paid). The pre-existing below-floor roll test
(`e2e_execute_pulls_nothing_when_insurance_below_floor`) has NO bid in the book, so the
roll->survive->settle path was previously untested. (The exact stale-refund line needs a
marginal-set-but-zero-COIN budget, a contrived dust case left to the analysis above since it is
provably overwritten-before-read; the e2e pins the realistic roll->settle correctness boundary.)

### [FIXED] AD. twap_authority signer seed not bound to its caller-configurable CPI target (twap-program) — confused-deputy insurance drain
The twap_authority PDA is the percolator insurance OPERATOR (granted by the handoff) and signs
`WithdrawInsuranceLimited` (in `execute`) and the operator-accept (in `accept_operator`) into
`config.percolator_program`. But `percolator_program` is CALLER-CONFIGURABLE — every config carries
its own — while the signer seed was `["market-0-twap", market]`, COARSER than the config seed
`["twap_config", market, squads, coin_mint, percolator_program]`. So all configs for the same market
but different percolator programs shared ONE twap_authority = the real market's operator. `init_config`
does NOT bind `market_slab.owner == percolator_program` (the twap is deliberately program-agnostic), so
an attacker could: (1) init a SECOND config at its own PDA with `market_slab = the REAL market` but
`percolator_program = a program THEY deploy`; (2) `execute` it — the twap derives twap_authority from
`config.market_slab` only, getting the REAL operator PDA, and invoke_signed's into the attacker program;
(3) the attacker program receives the operator's signature and re-CPIs the REAL percolator's
`WithdrawInsuranceLimited` (signer privilege propagates through CPI), draining the real insurance to
itself. The per-call `percolator_program == config.percolator_program` check is USELESS here because the
malicious config legitimately stores the malicious program. This is the classic "a PDA that signs into a
caller-configurable program must commit to that program in its seeds" footgun.
FIX: fold percolator_program into the signer seed — `authority_seeds(market, percolator_program) =
["market-0-twap", market, percolator_program]`. Now each config derives a DISTINCT twap_authority; a
foreign-program config gets a powerless PDA the real percolator never granted operator, and `execute`
through it signs as a non-operator that percolator rejects. Same defense the subledger pool authority
already uses (finding Q folds percolator_program into `pool_seeds`). Updated the helper, `init_config`'s
bump derivation, and all four signer sites (accept_operator, execute, shutdown's holding sweep, +1);
the legit handoff/execute/buy-burn E2E still passes because the grant and `execute` derive the new seed
consistently. Pinned by `e2e_twap_authority_seed_binds_percolator_program_no_operator_reuse`, anchored
to the REAL on-chain grant: setup_handoff rotates the percolator operator to env.twap_authority, and the
test asserts that == the perc-bound seed, != the old unbound seed, and != any foreign-perc derivation.

STACK-WIDE AUDIT (does this footgun exist anywhere else? — answer: NO). Every other PDA that signs into
a program whose id comes from account/config data either pins the target to a compile-time CONST or
folds the caller-configurable program into its own signer seed:
 - subledger: signs into `pool.percolator_program`, but `pool_seeds` INCLUDES percolator_program
   (finding Q) AND each handler re-checks `== pool.percolator_program`. Bound. SAFE.
 - genesis-vote `vote`/`trigger`: sign into `config.subledger_program` / `config.distribution_program`,
   but the `gv_config` signer seed `["gv_config", coin_mint, subledger_pool]` IS the config seed (1:1,
   never shared across configs) AND `trigger` checks `== config.distribution_program`. SAFE.
 - distribution `claim`/`burn_unclaimed`: sign into the token program, validated `== spl_token::ID`
   (compile-time const). SAFE.
 - program/src: `verify_percolator_program` pins percolator to `percolator_abi::id()` (const). SAFE.
twap was the lone outlier solely because its signer was coarser than its config; with finding AD it now
matches the rest of the stack.

### [FIXED] V. Refund-ATA brick → permanent auction DOS (twap-program) — SOL-class: account-closure griefing
The auction's COIN refund (claim / cancel / eviction) was delivered to the bid's stored `coin_ata`,
which `place_bid` set to the bidder's *arbitrary* funding source. A losing bidder could place a bid
and then CLOSE that account — after which `claim` could never deliver the refund (`spl transfer` to a
closed account aborts), the slot could never free, and the book stayed `SETTLED` forever, blocking
all future `execute` and `place_bid` — a PERMANENT DOS of the whole buy/burn, at the cost of only the
attacker's own (forfeited) stake. An arbitrary account address, once closed, cannot be permissionlessly
recreated, so the brick was permanent.
FIX: pin the COIN refund target to the bidder's CANONICAL ATA (`bidder_coin_ata` =
ATA(bidder, coin_mint)) instead of the caller-supplied source. Anyone can recreate an ATA, so a stuck
claim is always recoverable — closing it is a temporary, self-healing nuisance, not a permanent brick.
Pinned: `e2e_closing_refund_ata_cannot_permanently_brick_the_book` drives the attack end-to-end
against the real binaries (loser closes the ATA → claim fails + book blocked → recreate the ATA →
claim succeeds + refund delivered + book reopens). Probe-loop iteration 1.

### [BLOCKED] W. Malicious-DAO can't drain escrow/settlement via `shutdown` (twap-program) — probe #3
`shutdown` is a Squads-gated privileged op that sweeps the twap's USD budget (the `holding`) to a
DAO-supplied address. Attack: the DAO substitutes the book-escrow-owned `coin_escrow` (bidders'
escrowed COIN) or `settlement_usd` (winners' settled USD) as the "holding" to drain user funds to
itself. BLOCKED: `shutdown` requires `holding.owner == twap_authority`; the escrow/settlement
accounts are owned by the `book_escrow` PDA, so the substitution is rejected before any transfer.
So even a hostile DAO can't repurpose `shutdown` to steal bidders'/winners' funds — `shutdown` is
scoped strictly to the twap's own (DAO-owned) budget. Pinned end-to-end against the real binaries by
`e2e_shutdown_cannot_drain_escrow_or_settlement` (both substitutions rejected, funds intact).

### [BLOCKED] X. Reserve price blocks surplus-drain via an "expensive" bid (twap-program) — probe #4
The auction sells surplus USD for COIN at a uniform marginal price. WITHOUT a reserve, a hostile
bidder can offer ~1 COIN for the WHOLE surplus (rate ~0), become the marginal/only fill, and drain
the insurance surplus for almost no COIN burned — a real economic LOF. GUARD: the DAO-set reserve
(`reserve_num/reserve_den` = min COIN-per-USD); `execute` filters every bid with rate < reserve
(`cmp_rate(c,u,reserve_num,reserve_den) == Less → skip`). The reserve was previously UNTESTED (every
test used (0,1) = accept-all). Now pinned by `e2e_reserve_blocks_expensive_bid_from_draining_surplus`
(+ new `build_set_reserve_message`): with reserve 1/1, a 1-COIN-for-400k-USD bid is filtered — no
COIN burned, no USD paid, surplus preserved — while a fair (>= reserve) bid still clears + burns.
HARDENING NOTE: `reserve = (0,1)` is accept-all (no protection); a real deployment's DAO MUST set a
meaningful reserve (like it must set `reserved_floor`). A 0 reserve is a footgun, not a code bug.

### [BLOCKED] Y. execute can't drain a FOREIGN market's insurance (twap-program) — probe #5
execute is the sole insurance puller. Attack: a cranker points it at a DIFFERENT percolator
market's vault/authority to drain that market's insurance into this twap. BLOCKED: execute pins
`market_slab == config.market_slab` AND `vault_authority == perc_vault_authority(market_slab)`, so a
foreign vault_authority is rejected (InvalidSeeds) before the CPI — and percolator independently
binds the vault to the market. (This boundary lost its test when the standalone pull_surplus tests
were removed; re-pinned on the execute path.) Pinned: `e2e_execute_rejects_foreign_market_vault_authority`
(foreign vault_authority rejected, insurance intact; honest execute pulls).
Also analyzed (probe #5, ACCEPTED-RISK, no test): distribution `init_config` stores an ARBITRARY
`authority` and the config PDA = ["dist_config", coin_mint] is not authority-bound (cf finding P).
A front-runner could squat it with `total_supply=0` (the solvency check `vault >= total_supply`
forbids promising COIN it doesn't hold, so NO theft of the genesis COIN is possible) — purely a
setup-time DOS that forces a fresh coin_mint. Mitigation: the deployer mints + inits the dist config
atomically. Not fixed (benign, pre-genesis, recoverable); recorded so it isn't re-investigated.

### [BLOCKED] Z. Distribution bait-and-switch — redirect COIN after voters approve (genesis-vote/distribution) — probe #6
A proposal CREATOR registers a community distribution, lets voters approve it, then APPENDS a new
entry redirecting COIN to themselves before `trigger`. Defense in depth, both confirmed:
(1) `append_entries` enforces `total_amount <= total_supply` (line 422) — can't over-promise beyond
the funded supply; (2) the gv proposal snapshots `(entry_count, total_amount)` at registration, and
`trigger` refuses to seal if the live distribution proposal no longer matches (the snapshot check) —
so even a WITHIN-supply redirect can't be sealed. The tampered proposal becomes permanently
un-sealable; the attacker can grief their OWN proposal (it dies) but can NEVER redirect funds — the
sealed distribution is exactly what voters approved. Both guards were untested; now pinned end-to-end
(all 4 genesis binaries) by `e2e_bait_and_switch_appended_entries_cannot_be_sealed` (community entry
50/100, redirect 50 appends within supply, trigger rejected, dist config left unsealed).

### [FIXED] AA. Distribution init front-run → THEFT of the entire COIN supply (distribution) — probe #7
HIGH severity. The dist config PDA was `["dist_config", coin_mint]` (deterministic, authority NOT in
the seed). The funded vault is owned by that deterministic PDA. So an attacker who front-runs
`init_config` AFTER the deployer funds the vault could init the config with **authority=themselves**
and pass the deployer's already-funded vault (all guards pass: vault owned by the PDA, mint.supply ==
total_supply, mint revoked, solvency) — then seal a self-dealing proposal (signing as authority) and
CLAIM the entire COIN supply. (My probe-#5 note that this was "DOS-only" was WRONG: using the funded
vault makes it a theft.) This is the finding-P/Q/R class (init front-run) but UNBOUND here and the
highest impact — the genesis COIN IS the MetaDAO.
FIX: bind `authority` into the config PDA seed — `["dist_config", coin_mint, authority]`. An
attacker's authority now derives a DIFFERENT PDA whose vault they must own + fund themselves
(impossible without the COIN), so the legit (authority = gv config PDA) config + funded vault are
untouchable. Updated all 4 program sites (config_seeds + the create_account + claim/burn_unclaimed
CPI signer seeds) and every PDA derivation in the tests. Pinned by
`init_config_authority_bound_blocks_funded_vault_hijack` (attacker's init over the legit funded vault
rejected, supply intact; legit init succeeds). All suites green (dist 4+8, chain 39 incl. the full
genesis→buy-burn E2E which now uses the bound derivation).

### [FIXED] AB. USD-side refund brick (twap-program) — finding-V extension, probe #8
Finding V pinned the COIN refund to the bidder's canonical ATA, but the WINNER's USD payout target
(`usd_dest`) was still stored from an ARBITRARY caller account. So a winner could close their
`usd_dest` after bidding → `claim`'s USD transfer aborts forever → the slot never frees → the book
stays SETTLED → permanent DOS (same class as V, missed on the USD side). FIX: `place_bid` now stores
BOTH payout targets as the bidder's CANONICAL ATAs (USD = `ATA(bidder, collateral_mint)`, COIN refund
= `ATA(bidder, coin_mint)`), so closing either is permissionlessly recoverable (recreate the ATA →
claim → reopen), not a brick. Pinned: `e2e_closing_usd_dest_cannot_permanently_brick_the_book`
(winner closes the USD ATA → claim fails + book blocked → recreate → claim succeeds + 400k USD
delivered + book reopens). All suites green (chain 40, lib 4).

### [FIXED] AC. Compute-budget DOS via O(N²) Euclidean bid ranking (twap-program) — probe #9
HIGH-value DOS, CONFIRMED. The auction ranks bids with an O(N²) insertion sort, and bid-vs-bid
comparison used `cmp_rate` — a continued-fraction (Euclidean) loop whose length grows with the
operands' continued-fraction expansion. `usdc_atoms` was also UNBOUNDED (parsed as u128). A hostile
bidder who fills all 32 slots with close, long-CF (Fibonacci-ratio) rates makes `execute` exceed the
1.4M compute budget — `ProgramFailedToComplete` — a PERMANENT buy/burn DOS (execute always fails, and
a committed book can't be cleared except by waiting out the cancel cooldown). Confirmed empirically:
a 32-Fibonacci-bid book made execute FAIL before the fix.
FIX: (1) bound BOTH legs to u64 at place_bid (`as_u64(usdc_atoms)`); (2) rank bid-vs-bid with a
CONSTANT-TIME cross-multiply `cmp_bid` = `(coin_a*usdc_b).cmp(coin_b*usdc_a)` (u64*u64 < 2^128, exact,
no loop) in both the eviction scan and the execute sort. `cmp_rate` (Euclidean) is kept only for the
O(N) bid-vs-reserve check (reserve may be a large u128). After the fix the same worst-case full book
clears in **278K CU** (was: budget-exhaustion failure). Pinned:
`e2e_full_book_of_worst_case_rates_cannot_dos_execute` (32 Fibonacci bids → execute succeeds at
< 500K CU; a u128-huge usdc_atoms bid is rejected).

### [DESIGN] U. Buy/burn uniform-price (Dutch) auction — invariants (twap-program)
The COIN buy/burn settlement is a permissionless, time-boxed uniform-price auction (twap-program
tags 5-11). Security properties, each pinned by a chain.rs e2e against the real binaries:
- **Anti-spoofing**: a placed bid CANNOT be cancelled — there is no withdraw instruction; the only
  way a bid leaves the book before `execute` is eviction by a STRICTLY better bid (which refunds the
  evictee). A bidder cannot yank a bid right before the auction runs, nor stack a second bid. This is
  the deliberate fix vs the `twap/` library's `withdraw_bid`/`close_bid_escrow` (left UNUSED on-chain).
  Pinned: `e2e_bid_cannot_be_cancelled_only_evicted_by_a_better_bid`.
- **Uniform marginal clearing**: bids ranked by COIN-per-USD (overflow-safe continued-fraction
  comparator), filled best-first until the budget is spent; EVERY filled bid clears at the marginal
  (lowest-accepted) rate P*, so better bidders give less COIN than offered (surplus refunded). A
  DAO-set **reserve rate** caps the price the protocol will pay, bounding the marginal-bid
  manipulation where a whale's huge expensive bid drags P* down. Pinned:
  `e2e_buy_burn_uniform_price_dutch_auction` (asserts the real COIN mint supply drops by the bought
  amount — an actual burn — and both winners pay the SAME P*).
- **`execute` is the SOLE insurance puller**: the standalone `pull_surplus` was removed. `execute`
  (permissionless, gated on round expiry) pulls only `surplus * buy_burn_bps` (default 80%) as the
  budget and **ratchets the retained share into the principal counter** (`reserved_floor +=`), so the
  retained 20% stays in insurance, is reclassified as protected principal, and compounds — a bare
  pull that skips the ratchet can no longer exist. Finding O's floor (slab read at offset 749, finding
  T) lives here now. Pinned: `e2e_execute_pulls_only_burn_share_and_ratchets_principal`.
- **Permissionless place/execute/claim**; **futarchy-configurable COIN sink** (burn default OR send to
  an account, Squads-gated); **DAO shutdown** sweeps the TWAP's accumulated USD to a supplied address
  (Squads-gated only). Pinned: `e2e_shutdown_sweeps_holding_only_via_squads`.
  - SEND-mode coin sink (probe #2): in SEND mode `execute` transfers the bought COIN to the
    DAO-configured `book.coin_sink` (not burned). The sink is PINNED — a cranker passing any other
    coin account is rejected (`*coin_sink.key != book.coin_sink`), so the bought COIN can't be
    redirected to an attacker (LOF blocked). The SEND branch was previously untested; now covered +
    the redirection attack pinned by `e2e_send_mode_routes_bought_coin_to_treasury_not_attacker`.
- COIN escrow is pooled in ONE book-escrow account so `execute` burns/pays in O(1) CPIs regardless of
  bid count; the book is a fixed 32-slot array with O(n) worst-bid eviction; the canonical USD
  `holding` is pinned in the book so the rolled-over budget can't be fragmented.
- **No cancel/claim double-spend** (probe #14): `cancel_bid` refunds the FULL escrowed COIN while
  `claim` pays the settled `usd_owed` + `coin_refund`; if a SETTLED bid could also be cancelled, the
  bidder would get the full COIN back AND their settled payout (escrow double-spend). `cancel` rejects
  any settled slot (`settled != 0`), early, before the cooldown. Pinned by
  `e2e_cancel_cannot_double_spend_a_settled_bid` (cancel of a settled loser slot rejected, escrow
  untouched; the loser's COIN is refunded exactly once via claim, escrow drains exactly).
- **Permissionless-claim anti-theft** (probe #13): `claim` is permissionless (any cranker turns it),
  so the only guard against a cranker redirecting a winner's USD/COIN to itself is that `usd_dest` /
  `coin_ata` must equal the bid's recorded canonical destinations. Pinned by
  `e2e_claim_cannot_redirect_a_winners_payout` (cranker claims a winner's slot with its OWN usd_dest →
  rejected, settlement_usd intact; honest claim pays the winner). Also verified the subledger insurance
  pool's `vault` is pinned to the CANONICAL percolator insurance vault at init (finding Q + F-VAULT-FRAG),
  so deposits can't be redirected.
- **Uncensorability / eviction** (probe #11): once the 32-slot book is full, a NOT-strictly-better
  bid is rejected (spam can't displace real bids), but a strictly-better bid always gets in — it
  evicts the weakest and refunds that bidder (to the canonical ATA, finding V). Previously untested;
  now pinned by `e2e_full_book_evicts_only_for_a_strictly_better_bid` (full book; equal-rate spam
  rejected + not escrowed; rate-50 bid evicts the rate-1 weakest, refunds 1 COIN, escrow swaps).
- **Anti-spam fee**: a DAO-set flat per-bid COIN fee (default 0.002 COIN) is BURNED on every
  place_bid — non-refundable even on eviction OR cancel, so flooding the 32-slot book has a real
  cost. Pinned: `e2e_bid_fee_is_charged_and_burned`.
- **Cancel with cooldown (no race)**: an unsettled bid is reclaimable by its owner only AFTER an
  execute has cleared the book once (round_end moved) OR 2*round_length slots elapsed — so a bid
  can't be yanked at the last second to manipulate the pending execute, yet funds aren't locked
  forever. Only the escrowed COIN is returned; the fee stays burned. A settled bid uses `claim`.
  Pinned: `e2e_bid_cancellable_after_cooldown_keeps_fee` (immediate cancel + non-owner cancel both
  rejected; owner cancel succeeds post-cooldown with the fee still burned).
- **Full lifecycle**: `e2e_full_genesis_to_buy_burn` runs deposit → vote → distribute → claim →
  DAO/Squads handoff → buy/burn auction across all six real binaries; the COIN winner sells COIN
  back into the surplus buy/burn and it is really burned (mint supply drops), closing the loop.
- **Principal protection under loss** (probe #12): if a market loss drops live insurance BELOW the
  reserved floor (principal counter), `execute`'s `surplus = insurance.saturating_sub(floor) = 0` →
  nothing is pulled and the subtraction can't underflow. (Lost coverage when the standalone pull tests
  were removed.) Pinned by `e2e_execute_pulls_nothing_when_insurance_below_floor` (slab insurance
  dropped to 800k < 1M floor → execute succeeds, holding stays 0, real vault untouched, floor unchanged).
- **Multi-round ratchet liveness** (probe #10): each `execute` pulls the burn-share of the CURRENT
  surplus and ratchets the retained share into the principal counter; as FRESH surplus accrues, later
  rounds pull it too (no permanent lockout) and the principal is never pulled. Pinned by
  `e2e_ratchet_pulls_fresh_surplus_across_rounds` (round 1 pulls 400k + floor→1.1M; inject 500k fresh
  surplus via a timelock'd Squads TopUp; round 2 pulls another 400k + floor→1.2M; holding 400k→800k;
  insurance always == the grown floor). Confirms the repeating buy/burn works over time; no bug.

### [FIXED] T. Insurance slab offset read `vault`, not `insurance` (subledger + twap) — finding-O class LOF
Both the subledger pro-rata haircut (`subledger/src/lib.rs PERC_INSURANCE_OFFSET`) and the twap
surplus pull (`twap-program/src/lib.rs INSURANCE_OFFSET`) read the asset-0 insurance fund straight
from the percolator market slab at a hardcoded byte offset. Both used `448 + 285`, derived from a
hand-counted struct layout that assumed `V16ConfigAccount` was 233 bytes. It is actually **249**,
so `+285` is the `vault` field; `insurance` is at **`448 + 301`** (slab offset 749, confirmed by
`core::mem::offset_of!(MarketGroupV16HeaderAccount, insurance)` against the real percolator crate,
and by scanning a live slab: vault@733, insurance@749, remaining_budget_total@893).
`vault` = total tokens in the market = `insurance + trader capital + pnl`, so it is `>= insurance`
and equal only when there is NO trading capital (exactly the case in every prior test, which is why
the old `insurance_offset_matches_real_percolator_slab` canary — funding via TopUp, which bumps BOTH
vault and insurance equally — could not tell them apart and the bug shipped).
Impact (both the finding-O failure class): with live trader capital in the market,
(a) the twap `pull_surplus` would treat trader/depositor capital as withdrawable "surplus" above the
reserved floor, and (b) the subledger pro-rata haircut would over-count the fund and under-charge the
haircut (paying early exiters too much, stranding late ones). FIX: both constants → `448 + 301`.
Pinned now by: (1) twap canary asserting `INSURANCE_OFFSET == 448 + offset_of!(.., insurance)` AND
bumping the adjacent `vault` field to a distinct sentinel to prove the read returns `insurance` not
`vault`; (2) subledger `impair_market` helper deriving every loss-coupled offset from the real struct
via `offset_of!`/value canaries. Tests: subledger `impaired_insurance_exit_is_pro_rata` (order-
independent 50% haircut against the real binary) + full twap chain (33) green.

### [FIXED] A. Stale quorum denominator → minority capture (genesis-vote trigger)
`trigger` checked quorum against `config.outstanding_principal`, a CACHE synced
only on `vote`. Attack: vote early when the subledger pool is tiny (cache=6), let
honest deposits grow the pool to 1006 without a re-vote, then trigger: 6*2 > 6
(stale cache) "passes" → a 6-principal minority captures the whole COIN
distribution. FIX: trigger now takes the subledger pool account and re-reads the
LIVE `outstanding_principal` for the quorum check. Regression:
`genesis-vote/tests/seal.rs::trigger_uses_live_pool_outstanding_not_stale_cache`.

### [FIXED] B. Vote outlives capital (genesis-vote support tallies are snapshots)
FIXED via a cross-program vote-lock (a boolean, simpler than the candidate
`locked_principal` since one position = one whole vote). The subledger Position
gained a `vote_locked` flag and the Pool a `vote_authority` (= the genesis-vote
config PDA); a new `IX_SET_VOTE_LOCK` (tag 6) lets ONLY that authority toggle it,
and `process_insurance_withdraw` refuses while set. genesis-vote `vote` now CPIs
SetVoteLock(1) on back / SetVoteLock(0) on retract (config PDA signs). A live
ballot pins its principal in the subledger; capital can leave only after the vote
is retracted — which the owner always controls, so no permanent-freeze risk. This
restores the "voters must retract before exit" invariant the single-program
genesis had. Regression (KEPT, real-percolator e2e):
insurance_percolator.rs::vote_locked_principal_cannot_exit_until_retracted
(vote → withdraw refused → retract → withdraw succeeds). Original analysis:

genesis-vote records `voted_principal`/`support_*` as a snapshot at vote time, but
the capital lives in the SUBLEDGER and the subledger `insurance_withdraw` does NOT
require the genesis-vote ballot to be retracted first. So a voter can vote
(support += P), then withdraw P from the subledger (capital returned), and the
ballot still counts toward quorum/majority with ZERO capital at risk — a free /
Sybil vote. WORSE after fix A: the live-outstanding denominator shrinks on exit
while the snapshot numerator stays, inflating quorum. The old single-program
genesis enforced retract-before-exit; the cross-program split broke it.
Candidate fix: genesis-vote vote/retract CPIs the subledger to set a
`locked_principal` on the position; subledger `insurance_withdraw` cannot reduce
principal below `locked_principal`. (Subledger exposes the lock to a registered
vote-authority only.) NEXT ITERATION.

### [FIXED] B2. Vote-lock freeze-after-finalize (regression from B's fix)
Adversarial self-review of B's fix: genesis-vote `vote` rejected ALL actions once
a proposal was sealed (`pv.executed`), so a WINNING voter could never retract to
clear the subledger vote-lock → principal frozen forever. FIX: post-seal forbid
only NEW backing (VOTE_BACK); always allow VOTE_RETRACT (clears the lock; seal is
immutable; post-seal tally writes are unread). Regression:
insurance_percolator.rs::winning_voter_can_retract_and_exit_after_finalize
(drives the real trigger to seal, then proves retract+exit works post-finalize).

### [FIXED] E. Distribution vault solvency not enforced at init (claim-race LOF)
`init_config` recorded `total_supply` from instruction data and validated the
vault's mint/owner, but never checked the vault was FUNDED to total_supply. The
seal only enforces `total_amount <= total_supply` (the claimed number), so a config
whose vault held less than promised would let early claimants drain it and STRAND
honest late claimants (first-come claim race). FIX: init now requires
`vault.amount >= total_supply` (InsufficientFunds otherwise), tying the promised
supply to real tokens — a config can never promise more than the vault holds, and
since seal caps total_amount at total_supply, every sealed proposal is fully
claimable. Test (KEPT): distribution.rs::init_config_rejects_an_underfunded_vault.

### [BLOCKED] Distribution claim/seal/append/burn — full adversarial read (tick 5)
Probed the entire distribution fund-exit surface; all well-defended:
- claim: pull model (`pk == recipient.key`), sealed-proposal pin, vault pin, window
  bound, index bound, double-claim zeroing (amount==0 reject). recipient_ata is
  unchecked but that is the recipient directing their OWN allocation — not theft.
- append_entries: rejected once `header.sealed || config.is_sealed()` (no post-seal
  drain), running `total_amount <= total_supply`, checked_add, capacity bound.
- seal_winner: authority==config.authority, not-already-sealed, `header.config ==
  config` (no foreign-proposal seal), `entry_count > 0`, total_amount <= supply.
- burn_unclaimed: sealed-only, vault+mint pinned, `clock.slot < window_end` blocks
  premature burns. No tests added (would only re-assert existing checks).

### [FIXED] F. Foreign distribution proposal → unsealable winner (finalize DOS)
genesis-vote `register_proposal` checked `distribution_proposal.owner ==
config.distribution_program` but NOT that the proposal belonged to
`config.distribution_config`. A proposal owned by the distribution program but
under a DIFFERENT config could be registered and voted on; `trigger` pins the
distribution_config to `config.distribution_config` and CPIs SealWinner against it,
which the distribution rejects on `header.config` mismatch. So a foreign-linked
proposal that WON could never be sealed → the genesis could never finalize (the
whole bootstrap bricks; the COIN/MetaDAO never forms). Voters can still retract+exit
(no fund freeze) but the protocol is dead. FIX: register_proposal now reads the
distribution proposal header (disc `DISTPRP1`, config at [8..40]) and requires it to
equal `config.distribution_config` — every votable proposal is guaranteed sealable.
Test (KEPT, real cross-program e2e with a second distribution config):
insurance_percolator.rs::register_rejects_foreign_distribution_proposal.
NOTE (low-risk, NOT fixed): a proposal under the correct config but with
entry_count==0 would also fail seal (seal requires entry_count>0); but entries can
be appended any time pre-seal and no rational voter backs an empty (zero-allocation)
proposal, so it is self-correcting, not a forced DOS.

### [FIXED] G. Hostile vote_authority → griefing freeze of depositors (LOF)
`init_insurance_pool` is permissionless and records `vote_authority` as-is (no
validation). An attacker could front-run creation of the genesis's (COIN, asset-0)
insurance pool with `vote_authority = attacker`. `set_vote_lock` required ONLY the
vote_authority to sign — so the attacker could then lock ANY depositor's position
(`set_vote_lock(victim, 1)`), and `insurance_withdraw` refuses while locked. The
real genesis-vote config PDA is NOT the authority, so it cannot unlock → victims'
principal FROZEN forever (griefing LOF). FIX: `set_vote_lock` now also requires the
position OWNER to sign (and `position.owner == owner`). A position can therefore
only be (un)locked in the context of its owner acting on their own vote — the only
legitimate case. The vote_authority gate stays so the owner cannot self-unlock and
bypass retract (which would re-open finding B). genesis-vote `vote` propagates the
voter's signature into the SetVoteLock CPI. Test (KEPT, real-percolator e2e):
insurance_percolator.rs::hostile_vote_authority_cannot_freeze_a_depositor.

### [FIXED] H. genesis-vote init_config didn't bind its wired dependencies
`init_config` stored `distribution_config` and `subledger_pool` as-is, with NO
check that they bind back to the config being created. An honest orchestrator could
thus wire the genesis to a poisoned/foreign pool or distribution config (e.g. the
front-run pool of finding G), silently bricking it: a subledger pool whose
vote_authority != this config PDA makes every vote's SetVoteLock CPI fail (no one
can vote), and a distribution config whose seal authority != this config PDA (or
for another mint) makes trigger's SealWinner always fail (finalize DOS). FIX: init
now requires, for this coin_mint, that (a) distribution_config is a real DISTCFG1
owned by distribution_program with coin_mint match and authority == config PDA, and
(b) subledger_pool is a real SUBPOOL1 owned by subledger_program with mint match and
vote_authority == config PDA. The config can only be created against dependencies
that recognize it — fail-fast at init instead of a mysterious brick at vote/trigger.
Complements finding G (G stops the freeze; H stops building on a poisoned pool).
Test (KEPT): seal.rs::init_config_rejects_pool_not_bound_to_this_config.

### [BLOCKED] Own-vault init_pool vault-substitution theft (now pinned by a test)
Probed: own-vault `deposit` (tag 1) transfers owner -> pool.vault and `withdraw`
(tag 2) pays from pool.vault signed by the pool PDA. If `init_pool` accepted a vault
owned by the attacker, they could stand up a pool, lure a deposit into their own
token account, and drain it directly via SPL (program withdraw would fail). Already
blocked: init_pool pins `vault_state.owner == pool PDA` (src line ~350). Added a
regression to lock this anti-theft invariant (it was previously untested):
subledger.rs::init_pool_rejects_a_vault_not_owned_by_the_pool.

### [BLOCKED] Distribution premature burn_unclaimed (DOS) — now pinned by a test
Probed: burn_unclaimed is permissionless. If it could run during the claim window
it would destroy claimants' COIN before they claim (DOS/LOF on every unclaimed
recipient). Already blocked: burn checks `clock.slot < window_end -> reject`
(src). The timing was only tested on the after-window side; added a regression for
the rejection side: distribution.rs::burn_unclaimed_is_rejected_during_the_claim_window
(burn at mid-window and at window_end-1 both rejected; recipients still claim in
full; burn permitted at/after window_end).

### [BLOCKED] TWAP on-chain attack surface — none yet
twap/ is a pure instruction-builder + math library (no entrypoint, no
process_instruction, no invoke). The buy/burn on-chain program (task #2) is not
built, so there is no live attack surface there yet. Re-examine once it lands.

### [FIXED] I. twap-program init didn't bind the controller multisig to the DAO
twap-program `init_config` validated the controller was OWNED by the Squads program
but never read its `config_authority`. So a TWAP could be wired to a real Squads
multisig whose config_authority is an attacker (not the DAO) — the config would
"look" DAO-governed while the DAO had no control (broken DAO->Squads link). FIX:
init now checks the controller is a Squads `Multisig` (disc) whose config_authority
(bytes [40..72]) == the named metadao_futarchy (DAO). Regression:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs (a multisig controlled by DAO but a different
metadao_futarchy passed -> rejected).

### [OPEN/NOTED] twap-program init permissionless + not genesis-bound
init_config is permissionless and per (market). It enforces controller-owned-by-
Squads + config_authority==DAO (finding I) but does NOT bind to the canonical
genesis: an attacker could still front-run with a self-consistent (their multisig,
their "DAO") config for the genesis market, bricking the legit TWAP setup or
controlling the future reconfigure path (same class as findings G/H). Proper fix
(follow-up): require squads_multisig == the deterministic genesis squads multisig
for coin_mint (derived via the rewards program's [b"genesis_squads", coin_mint]
create_key) and bind coin_mint/market to the genesis. Deferred until the
reconfigure/rotate instructions (which the controller actually gates) are built.

### [OPEN/NOTED] twap-program pull_surplus is permissionless + bps not enforced
IX_PULL_SURPLUS pulls a caller-specified `amount` bounded only by percolator's
WithdrawInsuranceLimited cap, NOT by the configured surplus_buy_burn_bps surplus
share. Pulled funds land in a twap_authority-owned holding (program-controlled, not
stealable), so no direct theft, but an over-crank could drain insurance beyond the
intended surplus share — relies on the post-mint insurance-policy rotation to
surplus-only mode. Bound the pull to the computed surplus share when the buy/burn
settlement slice lands (it needs to read market insurance-vs-backing state).

### [FIXED] J. Genesis Squads timelock was 48h, not the documented 1-week
The README documents a 1-week Squads timelock as THE user-exit backstop (Safety §3):
every genesis authority rotation runs DAO→Squads(1-week timelock)→..., leaving the
old authority in place for a week so users can exit before any rotation takes
effect. But `process_init_genesis_squads` created the multisig with
`TIMELOCK_48H_SECS` (48h), so the real exit window was ~2 days — a 3.5x shorter
safety window than promised, weakening the core backstop of the whole authority
chain. FIX: changed the on-chain genesis-squads timelock to one week
(TIMELOCK_1_WEEK_SECS = 7*24*60*60). squads_handover.rs updated so the enforcement
tests (M4/M5) prove execution is blocked until a FULL WEEK elapses (they advance the
clock by the renamed const). 4 squads tests green against real Squads v4.
NOTE: pinning init_genesis_squads's value end-to-end needs the drift-broken
integration harness; the timelock MECHANISM at 1-week is covered by M4/M5.

### [FIXED] K. Distribution didn't enforce the fixed-supply COIN (README §4)
README Safety §4 promises "the COIN mint has no mint authority ... no program can
mint COIN" — no inflation/dilution and no "mint to drain". But distribution
`init_config` validated the vault (mint/owner/funding, finding E) and never checked
the COIN mint's authority. So a distribution could be created against a
still-mintable COIN, and the mint-authority holder could mint unlimited COIN outside
the fixed pool, diluting every recipient's governance/value. FIX: init now unpacks
coin_mint and requires `mint_authority.is_none()` AND `freeze_authority.is_none()`
(a freeze authority could freeze the vault -> DOS all claims). The fixed pool is now
provably the entire COIN supply. Regression:
distribution.rs::init_config_rejects_a_mintable_coin (mintable -> rejected; after
revoking -> accepted). Cross-program tests updated to revoke the COIN authority
before dist init (matching the genesis-setup flow).

### [FIXED] H-overconstraint. genesis-vote init wrongly required subledger.mint == coin_mint
Finding H bound the subledger pool's mint to coin_mint. But the subledger holds the
at-risk COLLATERAL, a DIFFERENT mint from the distributed COIN (README money map);
finding K (fixed-supply COIN) made the conflict explicit — the COIN can't be the
mintable collateral. So H's mint check would REJECT a correct collateral != COIN
deployment (a self-inflicted DOS). FIX: dropped the `subledger_pool.mint ==
coin_mint` check from gv init_config; kept the security-critical binding
(vote_authority == this config PDA, findings G/H) which is what actually prevents a
poisoned/foreign pool. Cross-program tests refactored to use a separate fixed-supply
COIN (gv/distribution) vs the mintable collateral (subledger), as in the real design.

### [OPEN/DESIGN] L. Insurance exit is first-come under impairment, not pro-rata
Q: does the subledger correctly handle venue haircuts + surplus?
- SURPLUS: YES. percolator caps each WithdrawInsuranceLimited to
  `insurance*max_bps/1e4` then (deposits_only=1) `min(deposit_remaining)`, i.e. the
  deposited PRINCIPAL. Market profit/surplus is never withdrawable via the subledger
  exit. Correct ("never touch market profits", README §2).
- HAIRCUT: NO (first-come, not pro-rata). The cap tracks the LIVE insurance, and the
  withdraw also requires `amount <= vault` (percolator v16 ~line 8542/8555). The
  subledger requests the full `amount` (capped only to position.principal) and
  computes NO health-ratio haircut. So under an impairment (venue loss dropping
  insurance/vault below total deposited principal) the exit is FIRST-COME: an early
  depositor withdraws full principal and drains the impaired pool; a later one is
  stranded. This contradicts the documented "pro-rata under market loss / finalized
  withdraw haircuts by health ratio". Demonstrated against real percolator:
  insurance_percolator.rs::impaired_insurance_exit_is_first_come_not_pro_rata
  (alice exits whole + drains, bob stranded).
  NOT fixed — design decision needed: (a) accept first-come during the voting window
  with pro-rata only at a separate finalize path, or (b) make the subledger compute
  the haircut. (b) is non-trivial: it needs the LIVE asset-0 insurance figure
  (percolator's internal counter, not the vault token balance, which also holds
  backing), so the subledger would have to read the slab insurance accounting or
  percolator would expose a pro-rata withdraw. Flagged to the user.

### [FIXED] M. Proposal bait-and-switch (change distribution after voters back it)
distribution `append_entries` is allowed until seal, and genesis-vote
`register_proposal` did not freeze/snapshot the proposal. So a creator could register
a fair PARTIAL proposal, let voters back the gv_proposal, then append self-allocations
into the unallocated supply and trigger — sealing a distribution voters never
approved. Since the COIN IS the MetaDAO, that is a path to governance capture (bounded
only by the §3 timelock). FIX: register_proposal now snapshots the proposal's
(entry_count, total_amount) into the ProposalVote (and requires entry_count > 0 — only
a built proposal can be registered), and `trigger` re-reads the live proposal and
refuses to seal unless both match. So the sealed distribution is exactly the one
voters backed; any post-registration append breaks the snapshot and the seal is
refused. Regression (real cross-program e2e):
insurance_percolator.rs::proposal_changed_after_registration_cannot_be_sealed
(register partial -> vote -> creator appends -> trigger rejected).

### [BLOCKED] Percolator admin proxy (program/ IX_PERCOLATOR_ADMIN) — analyzed
Forwards percolator admin CPIs signed by the market_admin PDA. Well-guarded:
(a) tag ALLOWLIST (percolator_admin_tag_allowed) — only lifecycle-scoped tags;
(b) governance-authority gate (authority == coin_cfg.authority, signer);
(c) LOCKED ENTIRELY until genesis is finalized (the #16/#19 fix) — no pre-finalize
admin ops while depositor capital is at risk; kickstart/recovery use direct CPIs,
not this proxy. Post-finalize the allowlist is the MetaDAO's intended lifecycle
controls. Even the allowed UPDATE_INSURANCE_POLICY can't drain principal: the
subledger operator caps every withdraw to position.principal regardless of the
market policy. No gap. (Hard to e2e — needs the drift-broken genesis lifecycle.)

### [BLOCKED] Distribution seal authority — gated + already tested
seal_winner requires `authority.is_signer && authority.key == config.authority`
(the genesis-vote config PDA). A non-authority sealing would bypass the vote
entirely (governance capture) — already pinned:
distribution.rs::seal_then_recipients_claim_their_entries asserts an imposter
cannot seal and the real authority can.

### [BLOCKED] governance/ adapter forwarding (init/handover squads, percolator admin)
The adapter CPIs the rewards program signed by a PDA derived FROM the passed
rewards_program ([b"rewards_authority", rewards_program, coin_mint]). A malicious
rewards_program only ever yields a PDA bound to itself (no impersonation of the
legit authority), and the real validation (governance authority, finalized lock)
lives in the rewards program the adapter forwards to. Trusted-forwarder pattern,
PDA-bound. No gap.

### [COVERAGE] Full genesis lifecycle e2e (all real programs) — pinned
No test ran the COMPLETE chain to a COIN claim; a broken link (e.g. the cross-program
seal producing a non-claimable distribution) would brick the genesis. Added a full
e2e with percolator + subledger + genesis-vote + distribution all loaded:
collateral deposit -> vote -> permissionless trigger seals the winning distribution
by CPI -> winning recipient CLAIMS the fixed-supply COIN -> double-claim refused.
insurance_percolator.rs::full_lifecycle_deposit_vote_seal_then_recipient_claims_coin.
This pins that the genesis actually yields a claimable distribution and exercises the
separate collateral-vs-COIN mints (finding K) through the whole flow.

### [BLOCKED] vote_weight arithmetic overflow (genesis-vote)
`vote_weight = floor(log2(age)) * principal` uses `saturating_mul` (no wrap/panic)
and accumulation uses `checked_add` (graceful error). Saturating to u64::MAX needs
~2^58 real deposited tokens — self-bounded by capital, not attacker-reachable. No
fix/test needed.

### [BLOCKED] Subledger insurance_deposit holding-account substitution
`process_insurance_deposit` does not validate the `holding` account, but the
TopUpInsurance CPI's internal SPL transfer is authorized by the pool PDA, so
percolator requires `holding` to be pool-PDA-owned; a hostile holding makes the CPI
revert (whole tx reverts, user's step-1 transfer with it). The user pre-funds
`holding` with exactly `amount` and is credited `amount` — no path credits more
than entered or touches another user. Well defended; no test added.

### [BLOCKED] Subledger pool/position substitution in genesis-vote `vote`
`vote` pins `sub_pool == config.subledger_pool`, derives the position PDA from
that pool + voter, re-checks the stored pool/owner, and requires subledger-program
ownership. A foreign high-principal position cannot be substituted. Well defended;
no test added (would only re-assert existing checks).

### [FIXED] C. Pool type-confusion: own-vault path accepted an insurance pool
The subledger serves both own-vault pools (tags 1/2, funds in a pool-PDA-owned
vault) and percolator-insurance pools (tags 4/5, funds in the percolator
insurance vault). The insurance handlers already gated on `!pool.is_insurance()`,
but the own-vault `deposit`/`withdraw` had NO matching guard. Attack/footgun:
call own-vault deposit (tag 1) on an insurance pool — the SPL transfer pushes the
user's funds straight into the percolator insurance vault with NO TopUpInsurance
CPI (percolator never counts them) and records an own-vault position; the own-vault
withdraw can never sign those funds back out (the pool PDA is not the insurance
vault's token authority) → principal STRANDED (user LOF). FIX: added the symmetric
`if pool.is_insurance() { return Err }` guard to own-vault deposit AND withdraw.
Test (KEPT — pins a real stranded-funds boundary against the real percolator
binary): subledger/tests/insurance_percolator.rs::
own_vault_deposit_is_rejected_on_an_insurance_pool.

### [FIXED] D. Active-path canonical-vault pin (GH issue #24 / PR #25)
GH issue #24 + PR #25 (@SrMessiSOL) report that percolator-meta accepts a
non-canonical Percolator vault. ADVERSARIAL REVIEW of PR #25: the diff derives
the canonical ATA `[vault_authority, spl_token::ID, mint]` under the REAL ATA
program id and equality-checks it — byte-for-byte identical to percolator's own
`canonical_vault_address` (F-VAULT-FRAG). It is ADDITIVE (keeps the existing
mint/owner check) and can never reject a vault percolator would accept (percolator
enforces the same pin), so NO DOS and NOT a backdoor. The PR is legitimate but
targets the DEPRECATED custodial program/, whose integration suite no longer
compiles on master OR the PR branch due to percolator interface drift
(WrapperConfigV16 authority fields renamed) — unrelated to the PR.
The same gap existed on the ACTIVE path: subledger init_insurance_pool checked
`owner == vault_authority` + mint but did NOT pin the canonical ATA address. Not
exploitable (a non-canonical pool is simply inert — every deposit/withdraw CPI
reverts with InvalidVaultAccount), but a fail-fast pin is correct. FIX: added
`canonical_vault_address` to subledger and pinned it in init_insurance_pool.
Test (KEPT): insurance_percolator.rs::init_insurance_pool_rejects_non_canonical_vault.

### [FIXED] N. Fixed-supply COIN: pre-mint dilution (finding K gap)
Finding K required mint_authority==None (no FUTURE minting) but not that the mint's
CURRENT supply equals the distributed pool. An attacker could pre-mint extra COIN to
themselves BEFORE revoking, then fund the vault with only total_supply — holding
undistributed COIN that dominates governance (the COIN IS the MetaDAO). FIX: init
also requires `mint.supply == total_supply`; with the vault-funding check (E) this
proves every COIN that exists is in the distribution vault. Regressions:
distribution.rs::init_config_rejects_a_mintable_coin (now also pre-mint extra ->
rejected) + init_config_accepts_a_fully_in_vault_fixed_supply_coin.

### [COVERAGE] Squads -> TWAP reconfigure: timelock-gated, proven e2e
The twap IX_RECONFIGURE is gated on the config's Squads multisig default vault PDA.
Adversarial review: the multisig is pinned at init (finding I: config_authority ==
DAO), the vault is derived from it, new_bps is bounded (0,10000], and a foreign
config only exposes its own multisig's vault — secure. Pinned both ways against the
REAL Squads v4 binary:
- negative (chain.rs): a random signer / the correct vault address WITHOUT a
  signature are both rejected.
- keystone (chain.rs::reconfigure_only_via_squads_vault_execute_after_timelock):
  the DAO proposes a vault-transaction that CPIs reconfigure; executing it BEFORE the
  1-week timelock is rejected (config unchanged); after warping past the timelock the
  execute succeeds and the buy/burn share changes. This proves the on-chain
  DAO -> Squads(1-week) -> TWAP control link end-to-end and that the timelock cannot
  be bypassed for a TWAP reconfigure.

### [COVERAGE] Handoff bridge (twap IX_ACCEPT_OPERATOR) + dual-sign insight
Security insight: percolator UpdateAssetAuthority (tag 65) requires BOTH the current
authority (asset_admin) AND the new authority to SIGN — a safety feature preventing
rotation to a non-consenting/dead key. So the handoff to twap_authority cannot be a
plain squads-execute of UpdateAssetAuthority; it needs a twap-program bridge that
co-signs as twap_authority. Built IX_ACCEPT_OPERATOR: gated on the config's Squads
vault (the asset_admin, reachable only via a timelock'd execute), it CPIs percolator
UpdateAssetAuthority(asset 0, INSURANCE_OPERATOR, new=twap_authority), co-signing as
twap_authority via invoke_signed. The squads-vault gating is pinned (chain.rs: a
non-vault signer cannot trigger the rotation; same proven gate as the reconfigure
keystone). NEXT SLICE: the positive real-percolator e2e — a market with asset_admin
= the squads vault, squads execute -> accept_operator -> operator rotates
subledger->twap, and the subledger can no longer withdraw.

### [COVERAGE/OPS] Percolator interface coupling — drift caught + handoff CPI verified
The genesis is tightly coupled to percolator's exact per-instruction account lists.
A percolator .so rebuild mid-session silently broke EVERY subledger insurance CPI
with NotEnoughAccountKeys (the deployed binary briefly wanted more accounts); a later
rebuild restored it. Operational risk: a percolator upgrade can break the insurance
CPIs in lockstep — the subledger/twap CPIs must be re-synced on any percolator
interface change. Now that percolator is back in sync, pinned the TWAP handoff
bridge's percolator CPI encoding against the REAL binary:
insurance_percolator.rs::percolator_update_asset_authority_operator_encoding_is_accepted
(UpdateAssetAuthority tag 65, asset 0, kind INSURANCE_OPERATOR=2, [current(signer),
new(signer), market(w)] accepted). This both verifies accept_operator's CPI and acts
as an early-warning canary for future percolator drift on that instruction.

### [BLOCKED] Insurance-policy change is marketauth-gated (no attacker drain-policy)
The handoff rotates the insurance policy (principal-only -> surplus-only) via
percolator UpdateInsurancePolicy (tag 33), gated on the GLOBAL marketauth
(handle_update_insurance_policy: expect_live_authority(cfg.marketauth, admin)). The
risk: if anyone could change the policy, they could set deposits_only=0,
max_bps=10000 and enable withdrawing ALL insurance principal (drain). Pinned against
the real binary (insurance_percolator.rs::percolator_update_insurance_policy_is_marketauth_gated):
the marketauth can set the policy (encoding accepted) and a NON-marketauth is
rejected. In the handoff the marketauth is the squads vault, so policy changes are
1-week-timelock-gated. Also a drift canary for the policy-rotation encoding.

### [COVERAGE] Slice 3 handoff e2e — DAO->Squads(1wk)->TWAP->percolator, four real binaries
The keystone §3 test, proving the dangerous operation (rotating percolator's asset-0
insurance operator away from the constrained subledger) is timelock-gated end to end.
twap-program/tests/chain.rs::handoff_rotates_operator_to_twap_only_after_timelock:
market-0 with marketauth = the squads vault; DAO proposes a vault-transaction that
CPIs twap IX_ACCEPT_OPERATOR (which CPIs percolator UpdateAssetAuthority, co-signing
as twap_authority); executing BEFORE the 1-week timelock is rejected; after warping
past it the nested squads->twap->percolator CPI succeeds and the operator rotates to
twap_authority. All four real binaries (squads v4 + percolator + twap + the chain).
This is the §3 user-exit backstop in action: any authority rotation is delayed a full
week, in the clear, with the old constrained authority live the whole time.

### [COVERAGE] Slice 3 policy-rotation handoff e2e (timelock-gated, four binaries)
The handoff's other half: rotating the insurance policy (principal-only ->
surplus-only) is timelock-gated end-to-end. A bad policy (deposits_only=0,
max_bps=10000) could enable draining principal, so it must run through the timelock.
twap-program/tests/chain.rs::handoff_rotates_insurance_policy_only_after_timelock:
squads-execute -> percolator UpdateInsurancePolicy with the squads vault as the
marketauth; blocked before the 1-week timelock, succeeds after. Both handoff
operations (operator rotation + policy rotation) are now proven §3-timelock-gated
through the full DAO->Squads->percolator path with the real binaries.

### [OPEN/DEPENDENCY] O. Handoff before surplus-floor -> twap can pull PRINCIPAL (LOF)
After the operator handoff (twap IX_ACCEPT_OPERATOR) the twap_authority is the
percolator asset-0 insurance operator, and pull_surplus is PERMISSIONLESS. pull_surplus
pulls a caller-specified `amount` bounded ONLY by percolator's WithdrawInsuranceLimited
policy, with NO surplus-floor (reserved_principal + retained_surplus_floor, README §5).
Under the genesis principal-only policy (deposits_only=1) percolator caps to DEPOSITED
PRINCIPAL — so if the operator is handed to the twap while any depositor principal
remains, anyone could crank pull_surplus and pull PRINCIPAL (not just surplus) into the
twap holding -> LOF for non-exited depositors. §3 mitigates (depositors exit during the
1-week window before the rotation executes), but a non-exiter is exposed.
Real fix (buy/burn slice, slice 4): pull_surplus must enforce a floor — pull at most
(live asset-0 insurance - reserved principal). That needs the live insurance figure
from the slab (NOT the vault token balance, which also holds backing) and the reserved
principal (the subledger pool outstanding). Until then: do NOT perform the handoff, and
the handoff proposal should atomically set the policy to surplus-mode. Documented with
loud SAFETY comments in twap-program pull_surplus + accept_operator. NOT a live vuln
(nothing deployed; handoff naturally follows the buy/burn build) but a sequencing LOF
risk recorded so it isn't missed.

### [O-update] Surplus-floor implementation blocker (slice 4)
Attempted finding O's fix: have pull_surplus compute surplus = insurance - reserved
and pull at most that. percolator exposes the clean accessor
`percolator_prog::state::read_market(slab) -> (WrapperConfigV16, MarketGroupV16)`
with `wrapper.insurance_withdraw_deposit_remaining` (reserved principal) and
`group.header.insurance` (live insurance). BUT adding percolator-prog as a twap-program
LIB dep FAILS the SBF build — it pulls in `wincode-derive`, whose manifest doesn't
parse on the BPF toolchain (`failed to parse manifest ... wincode-derive-0.4.6`). So
the clean in-program read is blocked. Options for slice 4:
(a) percolator exposes a lightweight, wincode-free accessor for (insurance,
    deposit_remaining) the twap can link; or
(b) the twap reads raw slab offsets for those two u128s — but the slab layout drifts
    (proven this session), so this needs a pinned percolator + a layout canary.
Until resolved, finding O stands: do NOT perform the handoff, and the loud SAFETY
comments in pull_surplus/accept_operator remain. Reverted the read_market attempt;
twap-program stays green.

### [STATE] Audit coverage summary (live code exhaustively swept)
78 tests green across all crates. Findings A-O recorded. The live/built on-chain code
(subledger, genesis-vote, distribution, twap-program) has been swept across every
guidance category and found hardened:
- account substitution / PDA-seed confusion: pool/position/ballot/proposal/config all
  PDA-pinned + disc-checked; no cross-substitution (A,F,H, vote/trigger pins).
- missing signer/owner checks: owner-bound exits, set_vote_lock owner-signer (G),
  seal authority-gated, reconfigure/accept_operator squads-vault-gated.
- account reinit: every init checks lamports/data_len==0; no account is ever closed,
  so no close-then-reinit.
- arithmetic over/underflow: checked_add/sub on all tallies/balances; vote_weight
  saturating; u128 for quorum/majority.
- type confusion: every account carries + checks an 8-byte discriminator.
- unchecked CPI: token_program pinned to spl_token::ID; percolator CPIs go to the
  config-pinned program; squads vault gating; the percolator-side authority is
  enforced by percolator (adversarially pinned: operator + policy rotations).
- rent/closing, sysvar spoofing: no account closing; Clock via syscall (not passed).
- bait-and-switch, vote-outlives-capital, hostile-authority freeze, fixed-supply,
  drain-policy, minority-capture: all fixed (A,B,B2,G,K,M,N) + real-binary regressions.
Drift canaries (insurance_percolator.rs) pin every percolator CPI encoding the code
uses (TopUp/Withdraw/UpdateAssetAuthority/UpdateInsurancePolicy) against the live .so.
OPEN, build-gated: finding O (surplus floor, needs a wincode-free percolator accessor
for slice 4) and the twap genesis-binding front-run (needs slice 2's squads-creation
port). No live vuln remains in built code.

### [O-update 2] Surplus-floor: confirmed needs a percolator-side accessor (precise ask)
Investigated the raw-offset alternative for finding O's floor. Result: NOT cleanly
doable on-chain.
- `insurance_withdraw_deposit_remaining` lives in WrapperConfigV16 (#[repr(C)] +
  bytemuck::Pod) at slab offset HEADER_LEN(16) + offset_of!(...): computable + stable.
- `insurance` lives in MarketGroupV16, which is #[cfg(not(target_os="solana"))] with
  Vec fields — i.e. the HOST deserialization, not the on-chain layout. The slab stores
  the group zero-copy with the Vecs serialized inline, so `insurance`'s slab offset is
  NOT computable from the struct (this is exactly why read_market/wincode exists), and
  read_market can't link into a BPF program (wincode-derive manifest fails on SBF).
PRECISE ASK for the percolator side to unblock slice 4's floor:
  add a target_os="solana"-compatible, wincode-free getter, e.g.
    pub fn read_asset0_insurance_and_reserved(slab: &[u8]) -> Option<(u128, u128)>
  returning (market_insurance_remaining(asset 0), insurance_withdraw_deposit_remaining)
  by reading the fixed scalars directly from the slab bytes. Then twap pull_surplus
  enforces amount <= insurance - reserved. Until then finding O stands (handoff must
  not run; SAFETY comments in place).

### [FIXED] M2. Front-run griefing DOS on register_proposal (genesis-vote)
Finding M takes a snapshot of (entry_count, total_amount) at REGISTRATION time and
`trigger` rejects the proposal forever if the live distribution proposal no longer
matches that snapshot. register_proposal was permissionless (only payer.is_signer),
so an attacker could register a creator's PARTIALLY-built distribution proposal,
freezing a stale snapshot; the creator's very next `append` would then make the live
proposal mismatch the sealed snapshot, and `trigger` would reject it permanently — a
front-run that bricks a legitimate proposal (it can never be sealed -> finalize DOS),
costing the attacker only the gv_proposal rent.
Fix (genesis-vote/src/lib.rs register_proposal, in the snapshot block after the
config-binding check): bind registration to the distribution proposal's CREATOR
(header [48..80]) — `if creator != *payer.key { return Err(IllegalOwner) }`. The
creator registers only once they have finished building, so no third party can freeze
a premature snapshot. Regression: subledger/tests/insurance_percolator.rs
`only_the_proposal_creator_can_register_it` (a non-creator signer is rejected; the
creator succeeds) against the real binaries. Green.

### [BLOCKED] Distribution claim/seal/burn — account-substitution swept, no new vector
Adversarially swept the distribution claim path (the COIN payout surface) for LOF/DOS
this tick. Confirmed hardened; no test added (would be tautological):
- pull-model impersonation: claim pins `entry.pubkey == recipient.key` (only the named
  recipient is paid) AND `recipient.is_signer`. Covered by
  `seal_then_recipients_claim_their_entries` ("cannot claim bob's entry").
- double-claim: the entry amount is zeroed after the transfer; re-claim hits
  `amount == 0`. Covered (same test).
- cross-config substitution (the two non-obvious paths, now reasoned explicitly):
  (a) feeding a FOREIGN sealed proposal into the real config is blocked by
      `config.sealed_proposal == *proposal_account.key` (the config names exactly one
      payable proposal); (b) pairing the REAL vault with an attacker-sealed proposal is
      blocked because `vault.key == config.vault` and the sealed_proposal both derive
      from the SAME config account — there is no way to mix a real vault with a foreign
      proposal. The vault-authority PDA is seeded by `config.coin_mint`, so each config
      can only sign for its own vault.
- proposal griefing: create_proposal binds `header.creator`, append_entries requires
  `header.creator == creator.key` (third parties cannot append to / brick a creator's
  proposal — distribution-side analogue of finding M2, already enforced here).
- window race: claim requires window OPEN, burn requires window CLOSED (no overlap);
  burn-during-window DOS pinned by `burn_unclaimed_is_rejected_during_the_claim_window`.
- supply/strand: init pins vault.amount >= total_supply, seal pins total_amount <=
  total_supply, so claims can never strand a late recipient. Covered by
  `init_config_rejects_an_underfunded_vault` / `append_cannot_exceed_total_supply`.
- OOB: capacity <= MAX_ENTRIES (10k), index < entry_count <= capacity, so
  entry_offset stays in-bounds; size math can't overflow.
Distribution suite green (lib 4 + integration 7).

### [COVERAGE] Winner-take-all is irreversible across COMPETING proposals
Swept the genesis-vote vote/trigger tally surface this tick (checked_add/sub on every
tally, ballot PDA-pinned per (config,voter), sub_position canonical-PDA + owner pinned,
quorum read LIVE from the pool). All hardened. Found one DISTINCT boundary with no
direct coverage and pinned it: the existing re-trigger test only blocks the SAME
proposal (via pv.executed). Two COMPETING proposals share ONE distribution config, and
post-execution VOTE_RETRACT is allowed (so voters can leave an executed A and shift
weight onto B) — so the genesis-vote layer alone does not guarantee a single winner.
The true winner-take-all gate is the distribution `seal_winner` is_sealed() check:
B's trigger passes every gv check, sets pv_B.executed, then the seal CPI fails because
the config is already sealed, reverting B's trigger whole. New test
(genesis-vote/tests/seal.rs `a_second_proposal_cannot_reseal_after_a_winner_is_sealed`):
A seals; B is then made to look winning at the gv layer; trigger(B) is rejected and the
sealed winner stays A. KEPT — pins the cross-proposal irreversibility (not the same as
the same-proposal re-trigger block). genesis-vote suite green (lib 3 + seal 4).
Also noted (not a live risk): total_cast_weight is u64 and each voter adds <= 63*principal;
the sum could in principle overflow u64 only at absurd aggregate principal (> ~2.9e17
base units genuinely at risk), where checked_add fails the marginal vote (no corruption,
just a failed late vote). Not worth a saturating change; recorded for completeness.

### [BLOCKED] Subledger fund-movement (deposit/withdraw, both pools) — swept, no new vector
Swept the actual principal-movement surface this tick for LOF/dilution/rounding theft.
Confirmed sound; no test added (would be marginal — the boundaries are already pinned):
- NO phantom-principal dilution: own-vault deposit (subledger.rs path) does a real
  owner-signed SPL transfer of EXACTLY `amount` owner_ata -> vault BEFORE
  `outstanding_principal += amount`; if the transfer fails the tx reverts. So recorded
  principal is always backed by funds in the vault — an attacker cannot inflate
  outstanding without funding it (which would otherwise shrink honest depositors'
  pro_rata = balance*principal/outstanding on impairment). Insurance deposit likewise
  moves funds via TopUpInsurance before bumping outstanding.
- Rounding favors the POOL, never the attacker: mul_div_floor floors every pro_rata
  payout, so a withdrawer always gets <= fair share; dust strands in the vault (not
  stealable — only the pool PDA can move vault funds). No repeated-deposit rounding
  drain.
- No impaired-pool first-mover advantage (own-vault): proven order-independent — each
  exit removes balance and outstanding proportionally, leaving the remaining ratio
  unchanged. Pinned by `impaired_pool_is_pro_rata_and_order_independent` (alice-first,
  asserts bob gets the SAME 50% haircut, not worse). Donating to the vault only RAISES
  others' payout; an attacker cannot remove from the vault. No sandwich.
- Haircut/surplus coverage is complete: own-vault fair pro-rata + surplus
  (`with_surplus_policy_returns_yield_pro_rata`); insurance first-come
  (`impaired_insurance_exit_is_first_come_not_pro_rata`, finding L, documented);
  payout() pure-fn unit tests cover healthy/impaired/with-surplus/guards both ways.
- Owner/PDA pins: every deposit/withdraw re-derives the pool PDA + bump, pins
  vault==pool.vault, position==canonical PDA, owner-signer + position.owner==owner.
  Covered by `principal_only_owner_exit_returns_funds_and_guards` and
  `init_pool_rejects_a_vault_not_owned_by_the_pool`.
Subledger suites green (own-vault subledger.rs 5 + insurance_percolator 15).

### [FIXED] P. init_config front-run squat -> permanent deployment DOS (twap-program)
twap-program init_config is PERMISSIONLESS and its bindings (squads_multisig,
metadao_futarchy, coin_mint, percolator_program) were caller-supplied with only an
INTERNAL consistency check (squads_multisig owned by Squads + its config_authority ==
metadao_futarchy). The config PDA was keyed on `market_slab` ALONE. So an attacker could
stand up a throwaway Squads multisig (config_authority = an attacker key they also name
as metadao_futarchy — cheap, one multisig_create_v2), pass the consistency check, and
init the per-market config FIRST with their own bindings. The squatted config is inert
(accept_operator/reconfigure are gated on the squatted multisig's vault, which is NOT
the market's asset_admin, so it can never rotate the real operator) — but the per-market
config PDA is now TAKEN and cannot be re-initialized (AccountAlreadyInitialized), so the
real DAO's buy/burn deployment for that market is permanently bricked. A post-genesis,
no-fund-loss, permanent griefing DOS; the market_slab is public so the front-run is easy.
Fix: fold the caller-set bindings into the config PDA seed — now
[CONFIG_SEED, market_slab, squads_multisig, coin_mint, percolator_program]. The legit
config PDA = f(market, real_ms, real_coin, real_perc); to land an account THERE an
attacker must pass exactly those, which forces the real metadao_futarchy (via the
config_authority check) and yields the CORRECT config (no harm). Any attacker variation
lands at a different PDA the real deployment ignores. No percolator slab read needed (so
NOT blocked on finding O's accessor), no owner check (keeps fake-market unit tests valid).
reconfigure/accept_operator/pull_surplus never re-derive the config PDA (they trust
owner==program_id + bindings), so the seed change is safe for them. Regression:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `init_config_front_run_with_attacker_multisig_cannot_block_the_real_deployment`
(attacker front-runs with their own multisig; lands at a different PDA; the real DAO's
init still succeeds and the live config is bound to the real multisig/DAO). Against the
real Squads v4 binary. twap-program suite green (lib 2 + chain 5).

### [FIXED] Q. init_insurance_pool front-run squat -> genesis deposits routed to attacker market (LOF)
Same class as finding P, worse impact. subledger init_insurance_pool is PERMISSIONLESS
and its market binding (market_slab, percolator_program, vault, vote_authority) was
caller-supplied; the pool PDA was keyed on (mint, asset_id) ALONE. The genesis pool PDA
= f(COIN_mint, 0) and the gv config PDA = f(COIN_mint) are BOTH predictable. So an
attacker could:
 1. stand up their own percolator market MKT_a (they are its marketauth) with the
    subledger pool PDA pre-set as MKT_a's asset-0 insurance authority/operator;
 2. front-run init_insurance_pool: pool=f(COIN_mint,0), market_slab=MKT_a, vault=MKT_a's
    canonical insurance vault, vote_authority = the predictable real gv config PDA,
    which PASSES init (vault is MKT_a's canonical vault) and later PASSES the gv
    init_config binding check (pool.vote_authority == gv config PDA).
Genesis then wires to a pool that routes every depositor's TopUpInsurance into MKT_a.
The attacker (MKT_a's marketauth) can then strand or bleed that insurance (hostile
policy / engineered market loss to their own trading account): depositor LOF, not just a
setup DOS. The real orchestrator's pool init also fails (PDA taken) = DOS even without
the LOF escalation.
Fix: fold market_slab + percolator_program into the pool PDA seed — now
[b"subledger_pool", mint, asset_id, market_slab, percolator_program]. The genesis pool
address can only ever hold a pool bound to the real market; an attacker's pool (any other
market) lands at a different PDA the genesis ignores. Own-vault pools pass Pubkey::default()
for both seed components (matching what they store), so the own-vault path is unchanged.
Threaded through every pool derive + invoke_signed seed set (init_pool, withdraw,
init_insurance_pool, insurance_deposit, insurance_withdraw). genesis-vote is unaffected
(it never derives the pool PDA; it trusts the stored config.subledger_pool key). No
percolator slab read needed (NOT blocked on finding O). Regression:
subledger/tests/insurance_percolator.rs `init_insurance_pool_cannot_be_squatted_to_misdirect_the_genesis_pool`
(attacker inits a pool bound to their own market against the real percolator binary; it
lands at a different PDA; the genesis pool still inits and binds the REAL market). On the
old seed the attacker pool PDA would equal the genesis pool PDA — the assert_ne + the
genesis re-init would both fail, so the test genuinely catches the regression. All suites
green: subledger lib 6 + insurance 16 + own-vault 5; genesis-vote 3+4; distribution 4+7.
NOTE: this is the same permissionless-init + caller-bindings + too-few-seeds pattern as
finding P (twap). Pattern to watch in any future init: bind the PDA to ALL trust-relevant
caller-supplied accounts, or land squats at harmless distinct addresses.

### [FIXED] R. gv init_config front-run squat -> genesis bound to attacker pool (LOF/DOS)
Third instance of the permissionless-init squat pattern (after P/Q). genesis-vote
init_config is permissionless and its config PDA was keyed on COIN_mint ALONE. It binds
a distribution_config and a subledger_pool, each required to point back at the (then
predictable) gv config PDA. The distribution_config is a UNIQUE PDA f(COIN) that can't be
forged (distribution init needs the funded fixed-supply COIN), so it can't be substituted
-- but the subledger_pool is NOT unique: an attacker could create their own valid pool
(vote_authority = the predictable gv PDA, bound to a market they control post-finding-Q)
and FRONT-RUN init_config to bind the genesis to THAT pool. Then every depositor's
principal routes into the attacker's pool/market (LOF), or the quorum is read from the
wrong pool (DOS), and the real orchestrator's init fails (PDA taken).
Fix: fold subledger_pool into the gv config PDA seed -> [b"gv_config", COIN_mint,
subledger_pool]. The legit gv address = f(COIN, real_pool); an attacker's pool yields a
different gv PDA the genesis ignores. And because the unique distribution_config's seal
authority is pinned to ONE gv PDA, post-fix only the pool that distribution commits to can
ever be bound -- a substituted pool makes `expected` mismatch the distribution authority
and is refused. distribution_config is NOT in the seed (it is already unique per COIN, so
unsubstitutable). Threaded through init derive + create_pda + the vote() and trigger()
gv-config signing seeds (config.subledger_pool). No percolator slab read (not blocked on
finding O). Tests: seal.rs Env derives gv config after the pool; new
`gv_config_cannot_be_bound_to_a_substituted_pool` (asserts the gv PDA now commits to the
pool -- fails pre-fix -- and that binding a substituted attacker pool is rejected by the
distribution-authority pin). All suites green: genesis-vote 3+5; subledger 6+16+5.
PATTERN now 3x (P twap, Q subledger, R gv): permissionless init + caller-supplied
bindings + PDA keyed on too few seeds. RULE: an init PDA must commit to every
trust-relevant caller-supplied account that is not already unique/unforgeable, so squats
land at harmless distinct addresses. Remaining permissionless init reviewed: distribution
init_config keys on COIN_mint and binds the COIN mint + vault (validated funded/fixed
supply) -- the COIN mint is the identity, the vault/authority are caller-set but a squat
there only produces a config for that same COIN (no misroute), and a re-init is blocked;
acceptable. twap init_config = finding P (fixed). subledger init_insurance_pool = finding
Q (fixed).

### [COVERAGE] Grand-unified E2E: genesis -> handoff -> twap surplus pull (ALL six binaries)
Built the full end-to-end lifecycle in ONE litesvm instance against every real binary
(subledger, genesis-vote, distribution, percolator, Squads v4, twap-program):
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_full_genesis_to_twap_surplus_pull`.
Flow: market-0 with marketauth = the Squads vault (asset_admin) -> DAO/Squads (1-week
timelock) injects insurance SURPLUS via percolator TopUpInsurance -> DAO/Squads grants the
asset-0 insurance authority+operator to the subledger pool (subledger.accept_operator, the
pool only CONSENTS) -> a depositor tops up REAL percolator insurance through the subledger
-> fixed-supply COIN distribution set up + the genesis vote/trigger seals the winning
distribution by CPI -> the winner CLAIMS the COIN -> DAO/Squads rotates the insurance
policy to surplus-mode AND the operator to the twap (both timelock-gated) -> the twap, now
the asset-0 insurance operator, pull_surplus pulls exactly the surplus, leaving depositor
principal in insurance. Asserts: insurance = surplus+principal after deposit; winner gets
the full COIN; twap holding receives the surplus; principal remains.
Design honored: the subledger NEVER rotates keys. Squads (driven by the DAO) is the
asset_admin and the only key-rotator; subledger + twap are pure insurance fund-managers
that only consent (accept_operator) to receive the operator role. The added subledger
accept_operator (tag 7) is the mirror of the twap's, required solely because percolator's
asset-0 UpdateAssetAuthority has no consent-free grant path (the incoming key must co-sign).
Stage-A (`e2e_squads_grants_operator_to_subledger_then_real_deposit`) pins the grant+deposit
half on its own. All suites green: twap lib 2 + chain 7; subledger 6+16+5; gv 3+5; dist 4+7.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: operator grant cannot bypass the Squads timelock
ATTACK: an attacker calls subledger.accept_operator DIRECTLY (not through a Squads
execute), signing as a forged asset_admin, to grant the asset-0 insurance operator to the
pool outside the 1-week timelock. The pool consents (its PDA is hardcoded in
accept_operator), but the inner percolator UpdateAssetAuthority requires the signer to be
the asset-0 asset_admin (the Squads vault) — an attacker key (and the plain payer) is not,
so percolator rejects. Confirms the grant/rotation is reachable ONLY through the real
asset_admin, i.e. a timelock'd Squads execute; calling the subledger straight cannot
sidestep it. accept_operator is powerless on its own — it only co-signs; percolator is the
gate. Test: twap-program/tests/chain.rs
`e2e_attacker_cannot_grant_operator_bypassing_squads` (real Squads v4 + percolator + the
deployed subledger). KEPT — pins the core authority boundary of the whole handoff.

### [OPEN/DEMONSTRATED] O-update 3. finding O proven end-to-end against real binaries (LOF)
ATTACK (finding O, now demonstrated): after the operator handoff to the twap with the
surplus-mode policy (deposits_only=0), a PERMISSIONLESS cranker calls pull_surplus and
drains DEPOSITOR PRINCIPAL even when there is ZERO surplus. Built end-to-end on the real
binaries: Squads funds insurance with 1,000,000 of PURE principal (no surplus), hands the
operator to the twap, then a cranker pulls 800,000 (80% = the surplus-mode max_bps cap) —
and it SUCCEEDS, moving principal into the twap holding. percolator surplus-mode caps to
max_bps of insurance and reserves nothing (it even zeroes insurance_withdraw_deposit_remaining),
so the floor MUST be enforced twap-side, which is not yet built. Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_finding_o_cranker_drains_principal_no_floor` — it asserts
the drain currently SUCCEEDS (a KNOWN-OPEN marker); flip it to assert rejection once
pull_surplus enforces `amount <= insurance - reserved`.
Confirmed the fix is still blocked from this repo: the surplus floor needs the slab's
asset-0 `insurance` figure. The canonical insurance vault token balance is NOT a usable
proxy (it is the market's shared collateral vault, not insurance-only), so the reserved
amount cannot be derived from (vault_balance - subledger_outstanding) on-chain. Needs the
percolator-side wincode-free accessor read_asset0_insurance_and_reserved (findings O,
O-update 2). Until then: DO NOT perform the handoff in production with depositor principal
still present.

### [FIXED] O. Surplus floor — twap reads the slab insurance directly (no accessor needed)
Finding O is fixed. The earlier "blocked on a percolator wincode-free accessor" framing was
wrong: Solana account data is globally readable, so the twap reads the asset-0 `insurance`
u128 STRAIGHT FROM THE MARKET SLAB bytes. The slab's zero-copy MarketGroupV16 header is a
repr(C) Pod of [u8;N] newtypes (align 1, no padding) at MARKET_GROUP_OFF =
HEADER_LEN(16)+WRAPPER_CONFIG_LEN(432)=448; `insurance` sits at +285 within it (after
market_group_id 32 + V16ConfigAccount 233 + asset_slot_capacity 4 + vault 16). So
INSURANCE_OFFSET = 733, pinned by the `insurance_offset_matches_real_percolator_slab` canary
(funds insurance with a unique value via a real Squads TopUp and asserts the slab bytes match;
fails loudly on layout drift).
Fix: pull_surplus now enforces `amount <= insurance - reserved_floor`. `reserved_floor` is a
new twap Config field (the reserved depositor principal), initialized to u128::MAX (so a
freshly-configured twap pulls NOTHING) and lowered only by the DAO via a new Squads-vault-gated,
timelock'd `set_reserved_floor` (tag 4). A permissionless crank can therefore never reach
principal, regardless of percolator's policy mode. The loud SAFETY/ORDERING-DEPENDENCY comments
in pull_surplus/accept_operator are updated to reflect the bound.
Regression: `e2e_finding_o_floor_blocks_principal_drain` (was the known-open demonstration that
the drain SUCCEEDS) now sets the floor = principal and asserts the cranker's principal pull is
REJECTED with no funds moved. `e2e_full_genesis_to_twap_surplus_pull` sets the floor = principal
and pulls exactly the surplus (insurance - floor), leaving principal intact. All real binaries.
twap suite green: lib 2 + chain 10.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: the surplus floor cannot be lowered outside the Squads timelock
ATTACK (integrity of the finding-O fix): the reserved_floor is the only barrier between a
permissionless pull_surplus and depositor principal, so re-enabling the drain just means
lowering it. An attacker calls twap.set_reserved_floor DIRECTLY to drop the floor to 0:
(1) signing with their own key passed as the squads vault — rejected (key !=
squads_default_vault(config.squads_multisig)); (2) passing the REAL squads vault but as a
non-signer — rejected (it must be a signer, and the vault PDA can only sign inside a Squads
execute). The floor stays at its u128::MAX default. So the floor is lowerable ONLY through a
timelock'd DAO/Squads execute, exactly like reconfigure/accept_operator. Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_attacker_cannot_lower_surplus_floor_without_squads`
(real Squads v4 + percolator + twap). KEPT — pins the integrity of the finding-O floor.

### [COVERAGE/SEQUENCING] E2E probe: the operator handoff closes the subledger exit path
The operator handoff to the twap is a POINT OF NO RETURN for the subledger exit. The
subledger insurance_withdraw signs as the pool, which is the asset-0 insurance OPERATOR only
until the handoff; afterwards the operator is the twap, so percolator rejects a pool-signed
WithdrawInsuranceLimited. Proven end-to-end: alice deposits, withdraws fine BEFORE the
handoff, then her withdraw is REJECTED AFTER the operator rotates to the twap. Implication: a
depositor who has not exited before the (1-week-timelock'd) handoff can no longer withdraw via
the subledger. Their principal is NOT stealable — the finding-O floor stops the twap pulling
it — but it is LOCKED until the DAO rotates the operator back to the subledger. This is a
liveness/DOS consideration, not a theft vector: it enforces the design's "exit during the
timelock window" requirement (README §3) and means a malicious DAO can at worst lock (not
steal) a non-exiter's principal, and only after a 1-week public warning. Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_subledger_exit_blocked_after_operator_handoff`. KEPT — pins
the handoff sequencing boundary against the real binaries.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: looping pull_surplus cannot cumulatively cross the floor
ATTACK (finding O fix, cumulative drain): a cranker loops pull_surplus to drain principal in
pieces rather than one over-pull. Because pull_surplus re-reads LIVE asset-0 insurance from
the slab on EVERY call and caps to `insurance - reserved_floor`, successive pulls converge to
the floor and never cross it — even across the percolator withdraw cooldown. Proven
end-to-end: insurance = principal(1,000,000) + surplus(500,000), floor = principal; the cranker
pulls 250k, warps past the cooldown, pulls another 250k (draining exactly the surplus), then a
third pull of even 1 unit is REJECTED, with the full principal intact in insurance and exactly
the surplus in the twap holding. Pins that the floor is stateless/live (no cached insurance, no
cumulative over-pull). Test: twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_floor_holds_across_repeated_pulls`.
KEPT — distinct from the single-pull finding-O test (this covers the looping/cumulative case).

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: a cranker cannot redirect surplus to its own holding
pull_surplus is PERMISSIONLESS (anyone may crank it), so the destination must be locked to
the twap_authority — otherwise a cranker could pull the surplus into their own wallet (free
money). pull_surplus requires `holding.owner == twap_authority` (the percolator
WithdrawInsuranceLimited dest-owned-by-operator rule, re-checked twap-side). Proven
end-to-end: an attacker cranks pull_surplus with a holding token account THEY own; it is
rejected, no surplus reaches the attacker, and the insurance vault is untouched. So a
permissionless crank can only ever move surplus into a twap_authority-owned account (from
which only the twap program, via the buy/burn slice, can act). Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_cranker_cannot_redirect_surplus_to_own_holding`. KEPT —
pins the destination boundary of the permissionless pull.

### [FIXED] S. Post-handoff deposits were drainable as "surplus" (LOF)
Found via the e2e probe loop. The handoff rotated only the asset-0 insurance OPERATOR (kind
2) to the twap, leaving the subledger pool as the insurance AUTHORITY (kind 1). So subledger
insurance_deposit (TopUp, gated on kind 1) STILL WORKED after the handoff. Because the twap's
reserved_floor (finding O) is a STATIC snapshot taken at handoff, a deposit made afterwards
raised the live asset-0 insurance ABOVE the floor — turning that new principal into pullable
"surplus". Demonstrated end-to-end against the real binaries: post-handoff a depositor topped
up 500,000, then a permissionless cranker pulled exactly 500,000 (insurance - floor) into the
twap holding — the depositor's entire principal drained.
Fix: twap.accept_operator now ATOMICALLY rotates the insurance authority (kind 1) to the
Squads vault in the same instruction it accepts the operator (kind 2). Both `current` and
`new` are the Squads vault (the asset_admin, propagated from the timelock'd execute), so it
needs no extra consent. After the handoff NOBODY can TopUp market-0 insurance, so no new
(unprotected) principal can enter and the static floor is sound. The subledger is fully
disconnected post-handoff (neither kind 1 nor kind 2) — consistent with "genesis is over".
Regression: twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_post_handoff_deposit_blocked_by_authority_revoke`
(post-handoff deposit is now REJECTED; insurance stays exactly the genesis principal, nothing
drained). e2e_full_genesis_to_twap_surplus_pull still green (the revoke happens after all
genesis deposits). twap suite green: lib 2 + chain 15.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: a freshly-deposited position has no vote weight (anti flash-vote)
Vote weight = floor(log2(age)) * principal, where age = now_slot - position.start_slot
(last-write-time). A position deposited in the CURRENT slot has age < 2 → weight 0, and the
gv `vote` instruction rejects a zero-weight vote ("position has no vote weight"). So a voter
cannot flash-deposit, vote with full principal weight, and immediately exit — governance
influence costs real time-at-risk, not just momentary capital. Proven end-to-end against the
real subledger + genesis-vote binaries: alice deposits and votes in the SAME slot (REJECTED),
then after holding a few slots her vote SUCCEEDS. Complements (does not duplicate) the gv lib
unit test of vote_weight() — this exercises the full path: real subledger position ->
weight computation -> vote-instruction rejection. Test: twap-program/tests/chain.rs
`e2e_fresh_position_has_no_vote_weight`. KEPT — pins the time-at-risk requirement of the vote.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: pull_surplus is locked to the config's market vault (no cross-market drain)
pull_surplus moves funds out of the market insurance vault, so its SOURCE must be locked to
the config's market — otherwise a cranker could point the WithdrawInsuranceLimited at a
DIFFERENT market's vault/authority and drain another market's insurance. The twap pins
vault_authority == perc_vault_authority(config.market_slab) (and market_slab/percolator_program
== config). Proven end-to-end: a cranker passing a foreign market's vault_authority (derived
for a different slab) is rejected, and the insurance vault is untouched. So a permissionless
crank can only ever withdraw from THIS market's canonical insurance vault. Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_pull_surplus_rejects_foreign_vault_authority`. KEPT — pins
cross-market source integrity. (Also added the `setup_handoff` harness helper to keep future
twap-side probes focused on the attack.)

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: one vote, one proposal — cannot back two without retracting
A voter's weight = floor(log2(age)) * principal is their CAPITAL's say; backing more than one
proposal at once would split or double-count that capital across proposals (vote-splitting /
double influence). The gv `vote` enforces one-vote-one-proposal: while a ballot is LIVE on
proposal A, backing a DIFFERENT proposal B is rejected ("retract your existing vote before
backing another proposal") — the voter must retract A first, which frees the weight. Proven
end-to-end against the real subledger + genesis-vote binaries: alice backs A, is REJECTED
backing B, retracts A, then successfully backs B. This invariant was previously untested
anywhere. Test: twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_voter_cannot_back_two_proposals_without_retracting`.
KEPT — pins one-vote-one-proposal. (Also added setup_genesis + register_proposal harness
helpers to keep future genesis-side probes focused.)

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: no surplus pull before the floor is configured (fail-safe default)
The handoff is several timelock'd Squads executes and the surplus floor is set in its own
step. In the window AFTER the operator rotates to the twap but BEFORE set_reserved_floor — or
if the DAO never sets a floor — reserved_floor is its init default u128::MAX, so pull_surplus
computes surplus = insurance - MAX = 0 and a permissionless cranker can pull NOTHING. Proven
end-to-end: insurance is funded with genuine surplus, the policy + operator are handed to the
twap, the floor is left unset (verified == u128::MAX), and a cranker's pull is rejected with
the insurance untouched. So a handed-off-but-unconfigured twap is safe by default; the
multi-step handoff exposes no funds at any intermediate point. Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_no_surplus_pull_before_floor_is_configured`. KEPT — pins the
fail-safe default of the floor.

### [COVERAGE/LIVENESS] E2E probe: post-handoff exit lock is RECOVERABLE (never permanent loss)
Extends the handoff-sequencing probe with the recovery half. After the operator rotates to the
twap, a non-exiter's subledger withdraw is blocked (the pool is no longer the operator) — but
the lock is NOT permanent: the DAO, via a timelock'd Squads execute, rotates the insurance
operator+authority BACK to the subledger pool (subledger.accept_operator, pool consents), and
the depositor then exits their principal. Proven end-to-end across the real binaries: exit
works BEFORE the handoff, is REJECTED after, and SUCCEEDS again after the DAO re-grant (the
previously-locked principal is recovered). Confirms the "principal is never permanently lost"
guarantee: the worst case for a non-exiter is a DAO-recoverable lock, never theft or burn. Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_subledger_exit_blocked_after_operator_handoff` (now the full
exit lifecycle: works -> blocked -> recovered).

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: minority turnout cannot capture the distribution (quorum guards turnout)
A minority-capital voter tries to seal their proposal by being the ONLY one to vote: they then
hold 100% of CAST weight (so the weighted-majority check passes trivially), but quorum is
total_voted_principal*2 > LIVE pool outstanding — measured against ALL deposited principal,
including non-voters. So a minority of live capital can never reach quorum. Proven with REAL
multi-party deposits against the real subledger + genesis-vote binaries: alice (400k of 1M
outstanding) votes and triggers -> REJECTED (no quorum), the distribution stays unsealed; only
once bob (600k) also votes does the trigger seal the winner. Distinct from the seal.rs
injected-tally quorum test — this exercises the full real path (two deposits -> outstanding ->
vote -> quorum) plus the positive case. Closes the "low-turnout capture" governance attack.
Test: twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_minority_turnout_cannot_reach_quorum`. KEPT.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: a voter cannot vote with another voter's position (no vote-power theft)
Voting power is the voter's OWN capital. The gv `vote` derives the subledger position PDA from
the SIGNER (sub_position_seeds(pool, voter)) and pins the passed account to it, so a voter
cannot substitute someone else's (larger) position to vote with their weight. Proven end-to-end
against the real subledger + genesis-vote binaries: alice (100k) signs and passes BOB's (900k)
position account — REJECTED (the PDA derived from alice mismatches the passed account); alice
voting with her OWN position works. Closes the position-substitution / vote-power-theft vector.
Test: twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_voter_cannot_vote_with_another_voters_position`. KEPT.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: only the winning proposal's recipients can claim (winner-take-all at claim)
Winner-take-all extends to the distribution claim: once proposal A is sealed as the winner, a
LOSING proposal's recipient gets NOTHING. The claim pins config.sealed_proposal (only the
winner pays) AND entry.pubkey == signer (pull model). Proven end-to-end with TWO real proposals
against the real binaries: a voter backs A to quorum+majority, the trigger seals A; A's named
recipient claims the full COIN supply; B's recipient (the loser) cannot claim from their own
never-sealed proposal B (config.sealed_proposal == A != B) NOR from the winner A (their pubkey
is not an entry there), and ends with zero. Distinct from the single-proposal distribution.rs
claim tests. Closes the "losing-proposal recipient claims anyway" vector. Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_only_the_winning_proposal_can_be_claimed`. KEPT.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: capital dominates hold time — no early-squatter governance capture
Vote weight = floor(log2(age)) * principal: log-time is a SOFT, sub-linear (capped ~63)
multiplier while capital is LINEAR. So an early SMALL depositor cannot sit accumulating
time-weight to out-vote a later LARGE depositor and capture the COIN distribution cheaply.
Proven end-to-end with two competing proposals and real deposits: an early voter (100k held
~1500 slots, floor(log2)=10 -> weight ~1,000,000) backs proposal EARLY; a later voter
(1,000,000 = 10x capital, held ~16 slots, floor(log2)=4 -> weight ~4,000,000) backs proposal
LATE. The early-squatter proposal LACKS a weighted majority (1M*2 <= 5M cast) and cannot seal;
the larger-capital proposal IS the majority and seals. Confirms the Sybil-resistance balance —
capital (the at-risk cost) decides, with hold-time only a tie-tilting bonus. (Stayed inside the
percolator oracle-staleness window so deposits remain Live.) Test: twap-program/tests/chain.rs
`e2e_capital_outweighs_hold_time_no_early_squatter_capture`. KEPT.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: retract/re-back cannot inflate vote weight (tally integrity)
A voter cycles back -> retract -> re-back on the same proposal, trying to make their
support_weight accumulate beyond their single capital contribution (a weight-inflation /
double-count attack on governance influence). The gv `vote` subtracts EXACTLY the stored ballot
weight on retract (checked_sub on both the proposal support and the global total_cast_weight)
and re-adds a single fresh contribution on back — it never accumulates. Proven end-to-end:
after the first back, support_weight == total_cast_weight == W (one contribution); across 5
back/retract cycles (age fixed so weight is constant) retract returns both to 0 and re-back
restores exactly W — never 2W. Closes the cycling-inflation vector. Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_retract_reback_cannot_inflate_vote_weight`. KEPT.

### [STATE] E2E attack-probe coverage map (genesis -> handoff -> twap, all six real binaries)
The probe loop has systematically swept the end-to-end chain. Full repo green (~98 tests):
subledger 6+16+5, genesis-vote 3+5, distribution 4+7, twap lib 24, twap-program lib 2 + chain 24,
setup 1+1 — no regression from this session's reseeds (P/Q/R), accept_operator, or finding O/S.
REAL bugs found + fixed by the loop:
  - O: pull_surplus had no surplus floor (LOF). Fixed by reading asset-0 insurance straight from
    the slab (offset 733, canary-pinned) and capping to insurance - reserved_floor (DAO-set,
    timelock'd, default u128::MAX).
  - S: post-handoff deposits were drainable (the pool kept kind-1 authority). Fixed by
    accept_operator atomically rotating kind 1 to the Squads vault, disabling deposits at handoff.
Boundaries pinned end-to-end (twap-program/tests/chain.rs), all BLOCKED:
  AUTHORITY/HANDOFF: operator grant cannot bypass the Squads timelock; reserved_floor cannot be
    lowered outside the timelock; no surplus pull before a floor is configured (fail-safe MAX
    default); foreign vault_authority rejected (no cross-market drain); cranker cannot redirect
    surplus to its own holding; repeated pulls cannot cumulatively cross the floor; finding-S
    deposit revoke; finding-O floor blocks principal drain.
  LIVENESS: post-handoff subledger exit is blocked but DAO-recoverable (principal never
    permanently lost).
  GOVERNANCE/VOTE: fresh (age<2) position has no weight (anti flash-vote); one vote, one
    proposal (no vote-splitting); minority turnout cannot reach quorum (no low-turnout capture);
    a voter cannot vote with another's position (no vote-power theft); capital dominates soft
    log-time weight (no early-squatter capture); retract/re-back cannot inflate weight.
  CLAIM: only the winning proposal's recipients can claim (winner-take-all at claim).
The high-value external-attack surface on the BUILT code is exhaustively covered. Remaining open
items are design/operational, not code bugs: finding L (impairment first-come vs pro-rata,
awaiting a design decision) and the unbuilt COIN buy/burn settlement slice (future probe target
once built). Future ticks: re-verify on any code change; target new instructions when added.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: a completed Squads execute cannot be replayed
The DAO->Squads->percolator handoff is a sequence of timelock'd vault transactions. A replay
attack: after a vault transaction executes (e.g., the asset-0 operator rotation to the twap),
re-run the SAME transaction to re-trigger the timelock'd action without a fresh
proposal/approval/timelock. Squads marks the proposal Executed, so a second execute of the same
transaction is rejected. Proven end-to-end on a fully handed-off market: the operator-handoff
vault transaction (idx 3) is re-executed and REJECTED. Confirms our multi-step handoff is
one-shot per step — a completed timelock'd action can never be replayed. (Our steps are also
idempotent/self-limiting, but this pins the squads replay protection in the integration.) Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_completed_squads_execute_cannot_be_replayed`. KEPT.

### [BLOCKED/RECOVERY] E2E probe: twap tracks the live floor across impairment + recovery
pull_surplus reads LIVE asset-0 insurance every call, so the floor is enforced dynamically in
BOTH directions. Pinned end-to-end: pull the full surplus down to the floor (insurance ==
reserved_floor == principal); at the floor further pulls are BLOCKED (surplus 0); the DAO then
refills insurance above the floor (a TopUp via the Squads vault, which holds kind-1 post-handoff
— or, equivalently, market profits refilling it); the twap RESUMES pulling exactly the recovered
surplus and STILL cannot cross the floor; it ends back at the floor with the principal fully
intact and total pulled == original surplus + recovered surplus. This is the "recovers after
h<1, then healthy again" behaviour — the floor never lets a permissionless cranker touch
principal whether insurance is dropping toward it or recovering above it, and the twap pre-empts
nothing. Test: twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_twap_resumes_pulling_after_insurance_recovers`.
KEPT.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: cannot vote without a subledger position (no free governance power)
Governance power is capital-at-risk: a voter must have a real subledger insurance position to
vote. The fresh-position probe covers a deposited-but-age<2 position (weight 0); this covers the
extreme — an account that NEVER deposited has no position account, so the gv `vote` cannot
read/own-check it (sub_position.owner != config.subledger_program for an uninitialized account)
and rejects. Proven end-to-end against the real subledger + genesis-vote binaries: an attacker
who deposited nothing tries to vote -> rejected; their position PDA is empty. So you cannot buy
governance influence without putting capital at risk. Distinct from e2e_fresh_position_has_no_
vote_weight (account-doesn't-exist vs weight-0 paths). Test: twap-program/tests/chain.rs
`e2e_cannot_vote_without_a_position`. KEPT.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: Sybil-splitting capital gives no vote advantage (core resistance property)
The whole premise is "Sybil-resistant governance": influence must scale ONLY with capital
at risk, not with the number of identities. Vote weight = floor(log2(age)) * principal is LINEAR
in principal, so splitting capital across many positions yields the SAME total as one large
position. Proven end-to-end against the real binaries: an attacker splits 1,000,000 into 4
identities of 250,000, all deposited at the same slot and voting the same proposal at the same
age (16, log2=4); the proposal's total support_weight == 4,000,000 == exactly what a single
1,000,000 position would produce, and the quorum denominator (total_voted_principal) == 1,000,000
(summed, not multiplied). So Sybiling neither inflates weight nor quorum — capital is the only
lever. This is the foundational property the design rests on; it was previously unpinned. Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_sybil_splitting_gives_no_vote_advantage`. KEPT.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: exactly half the capital does not meet quorum (strict-inequality edge)
Quorum is total_voted_principal*2 > outstanding — a STRICT inequality. So a voter (or set) holding
EXACTLY half the live capital cannot seal: a 50/50 situation needs strictly MORE than half to have
voted. If this were >= a tie could capture the distribution. Pinned end-to-end against the real
binaries: two equal 500,000 depositors (outstanding 1,000,000); with only one voting (500k*2 ==
1,000,000, not >) the trigger is REJECTED for lack of quorum, and only once the second also votes
(1,000,000*2 > 1,000,000) does it seal. Guards the strict > (vs >=) so a half-and-half split can
never seal. Distinct from the 40%-minority probe (this is the exact 50% edge). Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_exactly_half_capital_does_not_meet_quorum`. KEPT.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: a 50/50 weight tie between proposals deadlocks (majority strict edge)
The winner needs support_weight*2 > total_cast_weight — a STRICT inequality. So two proposals
each holding EXACTLY half of the cast weight TIE: NEITHER can seal. If this were >= both could
seal at 50% (double-seal / ambiguous winner). The tie simply deadlocks until additional weight
breaks it — preserving a single, unambiguous winner-take-all. Pinned end-to-end against the real
binaries: two equal voters (500k each, same age) back competing proposals A and B; triggering A
is rejected AND triggering B is rejected (each has exactly half the cast weight). A third voter
(100k) backs A, tipping it over half; A now has a strict weighted majority and seals as the sole
winner. Complements the quorum strict-edge probe (this is the MAJORITY/cast-weight edge). Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_tied_weight_between_proposals_deadlocks_until_broken`. KEPT.

### [BLOCKED/DESIGN] E2E probe: a non-voter's exit recomputes quorum (those who stay decide)
Quorum is total_voted_principal*2 > LIVE pool outstanding, so a passive holder's capital counts
AGAINST quorum only while it stays in the pool. The anti-stall property: a large abstainer cannot
indefinitely block finalization — they must either vote or exit, and EXITING shrinks outstanding
and hands the decision to those who stay. Proven end-to-end with a real withdrawal that flips the
trigger: alice (400k = 40%) votes, bob (600k = 60%) abstains -> trigger REJECTED (no quorum); bob
(a non-voter, no vote-lock) withdraws his full 600k principal -> outstanding shrinks to 400k ->
alice is now 100% of the remainder -> trigger SEALS. Distinct from the static minority-turnout
probe (here the abstainer actually leaves). Confirms exits dynamically recompute quorum against
the live pool. Test: twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_non_voter_exit_recomputes_quorum_stayers_decide`.
KEPT.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: a non-creator cannot append entries to another's proposal (no injection)
A distribution proposal is built by its CREATOR. append_entries pins header.creator == signer, so
an attacker cannot graft entries (e.g. a self-allocation) onto someone ELSE's proposal — only the
creator can append to it. Otherwise an attacker could inject a payout to themselves onto a popular
proposal before it is voted/sealed. The program-side gate (distribution/src/lib.rs:397) was only
exercised on the positive path (creator appends); the non-creator REJECTION was untested. Pinned
end-to-end: a creator creates a proposal, an attacker's append of a self-allocation is REJECTED,
and the creator's own append succeeds. Complements finding M2 (creator-gated register). Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_non_creator_cannot_append_to_a_proposal`. KEPT.

### [BLOCKED] E2E probe: no new proposal after the genesis finalizes (one-shot)
The genesis is winner-take-all and one-shot. Once the winning distribution is sealed,
distribution create_proposal rejects (config.is_sealed()), so no NEW proposal can be created on
the finalized config — preventing post-decision clutter or attempts to re-contest a closed
genesis. Proven end-to-end against the real binaries: a voter backs a proposal to quorum +
majority and the trigger seals it; a subsequent create_proposal for a fresh id is REJECTED, and
the sealed winner is unchanged. Complements the seal-irreversibility (finding R / seal.rs) — that
blocks re-sealing, this blocks creating new contenders after the outcome is decided. Test:
twap-program/tests/chain.rs `e2e_no_new_proposal_after_genesis_finalizes`. KEPT.

### [STATE] Coverage map update — distinct attack surface exhausted (33 e2e chain tests)
Full repo green (~107 tests). The e2e harness (twap-program/tests/chain.rs, all six real binaries)
now has 33 tests; every distinct attack class from the probe brief is covered, most from several
angles. Since the last [STATE] entry (at 17 chain tests) the loop added:
 - finding O FIXED (surplus floor via direct slab read + canary) and finding S FIXED (post-handoff
   deposit revoke) — the two real LOFs.
 - handoff/floor: floor-cannot-be-lowered-out-of-band, no-pull-before-floor (fail-safe MAX),
   repeated-pull-cannot-cross-floor, foreign-vault-authority rejected (no cross-market drain),
   cranker-cannot-redirect-surplus, live-floor tracks impairment+recovery, completed-execute
   cannot-be-replayed.
 - liveness: post-handoff exit blocked but DAO-recoverable.
 - governance/economics: anti-flash-vote, no-vote-without-a-position, one-vote-one-proposal,
   minority-turnout / exact-50%-quorum (strict >), 50/50-majority-tie deadlock, non-voter-exit
   recomputes quorum, capital-dominates-log-time (no early squatter), Sybil-split gives no
   advantage, retract/re-back cannot inflate weight.
 - distribution: winner-take-all at claim, no-new-proposal after finalize, non-creator cannot
   append (no injection).
ASSESSMENT: the high-value external-attack surface on the BUILT code is exhaustively covered.
Further ad-hoc probes would be marginal/redundant (reinit guards, capacity bounds, claim-window
edges are already covered by the per-program suites). The right next targets are NOT more probes:
 (1) the unbuilt COIN buy/burn settlement slice (probe once built), and (2) finding L (impairment
 first-come vs pro-rata) which is an open DESIGN decision, not a code bug. Recommend pausing or
 redirecting the 5-minute loop until there is new code to attack.

### [ANALYZED/BLOCKED] deposits_only-policy handoff: the floor protects principal regardless of mode
Investigated a subtle handoff mis-orchestration: the policy rotation to surplus-mode is a SEPARATE
Squads step; what if it is skipped and the twap pulls while the policy is still the genesis
deposits_only (principal-recovery) mode? Read percolator handle_withdraw_insurance_limited
(v16_program.rs ~8542-8558): the withdraw cap is min(max_bps*insurance/1e4, deposit_remaining)
under deposits_only, then bounded by insurance/vault. CONCLUSION: no LOF. The twap's reserved_floor
is an INDEPENDENT, tighter guard applied twap-side BEFORE the CPI — pull_surplus caps `amount` to
insurance - reserved_floor. So the depositor principal sitting in the vault (>= reserved_floor) is
protected whether the policy is deposits_only or surplus-mode; a permissionless cranker can never
pull below the floor in either mode. The policy rotation to surplus-mode is therefore a FUNCTIONAL
requirement (deposits_only caps the operator to deposit_remaining, which is exhausted/zeroed as
depositors exit, so the twap could not pull genuine profits under it), NOT a safety requirement.
Worst case of skipping it: the twap simply cannot pull surplus (functional failure), or percolator's
deposit_remaining accounting drifts under deposits_only — but the actual principal is never lost
(floor-protected) and is recoverable via the DAO re-grant (see the exit-recovery probe). No code
change: the floor (finding O fix, already pinned by e2e_finding_o_floor_blocks_principal_drain and
e2e_twap_resumes_pulling_after_insurance_recovers) is the binding guard and is policy-mode-independent.
