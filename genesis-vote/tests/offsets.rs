//! [branch-only, DO NOT PUSH] Finding ID — the gv counterpart of residual's offsets.rs (HL).
//! genesis-vote reads the subledger Position (principal, start_slot) for vote WEIGHT and the subledger
//! Pool (outstanding_principal) for QUORUM, via a hardcoded byte-offset MIRROR (gv depends on neither
//! crate at runtime). If the subledger reorders those structs, the subledger's own canaries + this
//! cross-pin fail — preventing the HF-class drift where gv silently reads the wrong field and
//! miscomputes governance weight/quorum (capture/LOF). Also pins finding IC's hardcoded distribution
//! program id against the real deployed program.
